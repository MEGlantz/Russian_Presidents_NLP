Mr Pavlopoulos     Pavlopoulos ProkopisPresident of Greece  arrived in Moscow to take part in the forum Russia and the World: A Look into the Future.  * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to meet you in person. You have a busy programme in Moscow. Today, your visit gives us this excellent opportunity to declare the opening of the Year of Russia in Greece and the Year of Greece in Russia. These programmes will see more than 30 different events take place, nearly 40 in fact, 37 events in all. There will be Greek exhibitions at the Hermitage, at the Historical Museum in Moscow, Russian companies will take part in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, and we will organise a round table as part of the 20th St Petersburg International Economic Forum.  Mr President, it is a great pleasure to welcome to Moscow the head of state of Greece, a friendly country with which we share unique historical ties. Welcome!  President of Greece Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for your hospitality and for this reception. I thank you too for the fact that our meeting effectively opens the Year of Greece in Russia and the Year of Russia in Greece. The planned events can and will build closer ties between our close and friendly peoples.  I think that this year will bring us the pleasure of having the opportunity to receive you in Athens. It is your turn to come to Athens now. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Prokopis Pavlopoulos: Mr President, on behalf of the Greek people, the Greek government, and all democratic forces in Greece, I want to say that we value most highly Russia\\u2019s contribution to resolving the world\\u2019s current problems and confronting challenges that are not so much economic as humanitarian in nature.  I believe that no matter what the differences between Russia and the European Union, they can be resolved through dialogue. I think that no matter what these differences may be, they are of little significance compared to the challenges we face at the global level: the need to end the war in the Middle East, in Syria, restore peace, protect people, fight terrorism, which threatens the entire international community, and defeat ISIS.  <\\u2026>\",\n          \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party\\u2019s plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party\\u2019s multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party\\u2019s concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people\\u2019s programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people\\u2019s incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress\\u2019 previous stages.  I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments.  Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people\\u2019s programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people\\u2019s current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them.  I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party\\u2019s local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people\\u2019s safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia\\u2019s sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children.  I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle.  We stand together for Russia.\",\n          \"The President\\u2019s participation in the Congress was not planned, but, as Vladimir Putin said addressing the forum participants, he found it necessary to clarify the national leadership\\u2019s position on these important issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, This is an unusual event, an unusual forum: the Russian Congress of Parents. All of us are parents, at least the majority of Russians are. I understand that today we have a meeting of the core group of parents. Your agenda includes a number of issues that have great importance to our society. I just came in and was told that Mr Kurginyan spoke before me and his speech was very emotional. This is understandable because these issues are very acute and they concern everyone. I thought it was my duty to meet with you and explain my own position on these issues, the position of the country\\u2019s leadership. Especially since I have received a petition, which was addressed to me personally and signed by 141,000 people. I am sure that there would have been even more signatories if everyone interested in this issue had the opportunity to sign the petition. People are truly concerned about and opposed to some mechanisms that are part of the juvenile justice system. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the draft laws proposing direct or indirect regulation of relations between parents and children, as well as special legal mechanisms regarding work with minors. I think everybody realises that it would be wrong to leave absolutely everything as it is. We must move forward, utilise modern techniques that are used in other countries but this should be done very carefully. I would like to say a few words about this issue. This concerns two laws. The first was submitted by the President in March 2012, and the second by the Government on September 25, 2012. As I understand it, those are the laws in question. I would like to make a few points in this regard. First. Public opinion will certainly be heard and taken into account. In these matters, in adopting such laws, there is no room for secrecy or forcing unwanted legislation on society. I would go even further: this applies to all government decisions, or at least that is how it should be. Second, I agree that a number of the draft laws\\u2019 provisions on foster care and control over orphans\\u2019 rights, may be ambiguous and contain explicit social risks. Most importantly, they do not take Russian family traditions fully into account. Russia is a very big country with great ethnic and cultural diversity. There are some regions, for example, the Northern Caucasus (I see representatives of the Northern Caucasus here), where child homelessness and abandonment are historically unknown. Russians and almost all the peoples of Russia have centuries-old traditions of a big family, which unites several generations. Care for the elderly and the children always had special importance. We must revive these traditions, while at the same time making every effort to avoid blindly copying other cultures\\u2019 experience. This is because the management models of social phenomena are controversial in these spheres and in those countries where the rules of juvenile justice are most widely applied. There are some advantages and great many disadvantages. Incidentally, the general public is aware of these disadvantages as experienced by Russian families living abroad. There are many examples where normal, loving and hard-working parents lose custody of their children. Some cases of interference in family life are just absurd and make a mockery of justice. An ill-considered introduction of such mechanisms can lead to the violation of family sovereignty, cause distrust and discord between parents and children, and even outright corruption, when some unscrupulous officials take advantage of such situations. Certainly, we must and will listen to your opinions. I want to assure you of that. Draft laws must be subjected to the most thorough public debate and can only be adopted \\u2013 if they are adopted at all \\u2013 in the event that consensus can be reached on their main provisions. Only then will a draft law\\u2019s sound provisions designed to support families and children gain strong public support. Family law is a very sensitive area. The laws regulating the relationship between parents and children should contain only the most unambiguous and clear language, eliminating bureaucratic abuses and multiple interpretations. The legal drafting methodology must be perfected until it is as good as it can be. In particular, there must be a strict and exhaustive list of signs of extreme distress within a family, when the authorities can and must intervene and provide targeted assistance. Sometimes the situation calls for urgent action on the part of the state, especially when the rights and even the life of a child are at stake. I am sure you will agree with me that intervention in such cases is necessary. Naturally, each case is different and every detail must be taken into account. It is essential not only to act resolutely but also, most importantly, with utmost sensitivity. An impersonal, formal approach must be avoided at all cost and every effort must be made to keep the family together and provide it the support it needs. Success of the efforts for prosperous, secure children\\u2019s lives should not be measured by the number of cases when parents lose custody of their children. That is not the yardstick we should use. On the contrary, the loss of custody is very problematic solution and should be used as a last resort. Sometimes it can be just a dead end. It is an intentional or unintentional destruction of the traditional Russian family, and a strong and happy family cannot be replaced by any law or government oversight agency. That much is certain. What is far more important is to remove the causes of social ills. Of course, this requires long-term systemic efforts that are far more demanding. We must pay constant attention to families, especially those that find themselves in difficult situations; we must work with parents who refuse to bring up their children, provide timely psychological and other assistance to pregnant women who have doubts about their ability to raise the child alone. We have a well-developed legal system and normative base, both our own and international, which we have joined. Russia is party to a number of international legal instruments. We must use this to our advantage and increase these instruments\\u2019 effectiveness. However, I would like to touch on another very important issue: support for the institution of adoption. We must do everything we can to make sure that orphans are adopted by families in their own country, in Russia. You are all aware of the executive order signed at the end of December 2012. The Government was issued instructions to simplify adoption, guardianship and foster care procedures for orphaned and abandoned children, and to take measures to provide tax benefits for the adoptive and foster families, increase the lump sum payments families are entitled to when they adopt a child and the benefits paid to disabled children and persons with class I disabilities from childhood. All these measures will add up to tangible support for our citizens who decide to take in a child from an orphanage. Perhaps we will find other effective support measures with your help. Surveys show that there are more and more people like that, including people wishing to adopt including disabled children and children with special needs. I want to stress that Russian families that adopt children should receive support not only from the state but also from the whole society. Here, we look forward to your active contribution and support. The family must be in the centre of public attention and we should see the family as our national heritage. Since occasions like this are rare, I would like to raise another matter. It is not directly related to the family or the draft laws you have met here to discuss, but your agenda will probably expand to include other issues. It has to do with child education and work with children, and one aspect seems to me particularly important in this regard, especially since it is surrounded by the same special, increased attention from society. I am talking about a standard literature curriculum. As you know, the new curriculum has indeed provoked considerable debate. I share the opinion that some new authors have replaced some works of literature that make up the historical heritage of our country. By the way, I think it is good that there are new authors. True, not everyone shares their political views or the subject matter of their writing. Even so, modern Russian literature is part of world literature, and I believe that we should treat it with respect. However, when the school curriculum excludes Kuprin, Leskov and Alexei Tolstoi, Pushkin\\u2019s The Bronze Horseman, Chekhov\\u2019s The Lady with a Dog or The Man in a Case, and poems by Akhmadulina, Vysotsky and Okudzhava, the question immediately arises: why has this happened and what has replaced them? Let me express a view that may be controversial and perhaps many of you will not agree with me, but I think even serious works of literature may sometimes have obscene language or contain scenes that readers may find shocking, but should such books be part of the compulsory curriculum at school \\u2013 that is the question. I agree with those who question this decision. I believe that the authors of the new literature curriculum should pay attention to criticism, especially since many comments are reasonable, as I have said. Therefore, I expect that the relevant agencies will draw certain conclusions. Friends, I am sure that the people who have met here today are true patriots of our country, true patriots of Russia. This is evidenced by your strong feelings and proactive approach to the events taking place in our country. We can only support your desire to contribute to its successful development. We are grateful for and unconditionally support your concern for the family and the increasing role of patriotic values and civic consciousness in the education of our children. You should have no doubt about it. I am confident that this forum, which brought together like-minded people from many Russian regions, will generate new and exciting ideas that will be needed and realised. We are ready for close partnership and collaboration. I wish you fruitful deliberations. Thank you very much for your position.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"place\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 814,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Lisbon\",\n          \"Cyprus\",\n          \"Alushta\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7548,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Meeting on socioeconomic development of Crimea and Sevastopol\",\n          \"Extracts from a Speech to the Second Poland-Russia Economic Forum\",\n          \"Leaders Summit on Climate\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"no_contract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"transcript_unfiltered_str\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9619,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The subjects of discussion covered bilateral relations, including organisation of the Year of Russia in Greece and Year of Greece in Russia in 2016, and current international affairs. Mr Pavlopoulos Pavlopoulos ProkopisPresident of Greece arrived in Moscow to take part in the forum Russia and the World: A Look into the Future. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to meet you in person. You have a busy programme in Moscow. Today, your visit gives us this excellent opportunity to declare the opening of the Year of Russia in Greece and the Year of Greece in Russia. These programmes will see more than 30 different events take place, nearly 40 in fact, 37 events in all. There will be Greek exhibitions at the Hermitage, at the Historical Museum in Moscow, Russian companies will take part in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, and we will organise a round table as part of the 20th St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Mr President, it is a great pleasure to welcome to Moscow the head of state of Greece, a friendly country with which we share unique historical ties. Welcome! President of Greece Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for your hospitality and for this reception. I thank you too for the fact that our meeting effectively opens the Year of Greece in Russia and the Year of Russia in Greece. The planned events can and will build closer ties between our close and friendly peoples. I think that this year will bring us the pleasure of having the opportunity to receive you in Athens. It is your turn to come to Athens now. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Prokopis Pavlopoulos: Mr President, on behalf of the Greek people, the Greek government, and all democratic forces in Greece, I want to say that we value most highly Russia\\u2019s contribution to resolving the world\\u2019s current problems and confronting challenges that are not so much economic as humanitarian in nature. I believe that no matter what the differences between Russia and the European Union, they can be resolved through dialogue. I think that no matter what these differences may be, they are of little significance compared to the challenges we face at the global level: the need to end the war in the Middle East, in Syria, restore peace, protect people, fight terrorism, which threatens the entire international community, and defeat ISIS. <\\u2026>\",\n          \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party\\u2019s plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party\\u2019s multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party\\u2019s concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people\\u2019s programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people\\u2019s incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress\\u2019 previous stages. I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments. Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people\\u2019s programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people\\u2019s current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them. I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party\\u2019s local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people\\u2019s safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia\\u2019s sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children. I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle. We stand together for Russia.\",\n          \"The President\\u2019s participation in the Congress was not planned, but, as Vladimir Putin said addressing the forum participants, he found it necessary to clarify the national leadership\\u2019s position on these important issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, This is an unusual event, an unusual forum: the Russian Congress of Parents. All of us are parents, at least the majority of Russians are. I understand that today we have a meeting of the core group of parents. Your agenda includes a number of issues that have great importance to our society. I just came in and was told that Mr Kurginyan spoke before me and his speech was very emotional. This is understandable because these issues are very acute and they concern everyone. I thought it was my duty to meet with you and explain my own position on these issues, the position of the country\\u2019s leadership. Especially since I have received a petition, which was addressed to me personally and signed by 141,000 people. I am sure that there would have been even more signatories if everyone interested in this issue had the opportunity to sign the petition. People are truly concerned about and opposed to some mechanisms that are part of the juvenile justice system. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the draft laws proposing direct or indirect regulation of relations between parents and children, as well as special legal mechanisms regarding work with minors. I think everybody realises that it would be wrong to leave absolutely everything as it is. We must move forward, utilise modern techniques that are used in other countries but this should be done very carefully. I would like to say a few words about this issue. This concerns two laws. The first was submitted by the President in March 2012, and the second by the Government on September 25, 2012. As I understand it, those are the laws in question. I would like to make a few points in this regard. First. Public opinion will certainly be heard and taken into account. In these matters, in adopting such laws, there is no room for secrecy or forcing unwanted legislation on society. I would go even further: this applies to all government decisions, or at least that is how it should be. Second, I agree that a number of the draft laws\\u2019 provisions on foster care and control over orphans\\u2019 rights, may be ambiguous and contain explicit social risks. Most importantly, they do not take Russian family traditions fully into account. Russia is a very big country with great ethnic and cultural diversity. There are some regions, for example, the Northern Caucasus (I see representatives of the Northern Caucasus here), where child homelessness and abandonment are historically unknown. Russians and almost all the peoples of Russia have centuries-old traditions of a big family, which unites several generations. Care for the elderly and the children always had special importance. We must revive these traditions, while at the same time making every effort to avoid blindly copying other cultures\\u2019 experience. This is because the management models of social phenomena are controversial in these spheres and in those countries where the rules of juvenile justice are most widely applied. There are some advantages and great many disadvantages. Incidentally, the general public is aware of these disadvantages as experienced by Russian families living abroad. There are many examples where normal, loving and hard-working parents lose custody of their children. Some cases of interference in family life are just absurd and make a mockery of justice.

Mr Pavlopoulos     Pavlopoulos ProkopisPresident of Greece  arrived in Moscow to take part in the forum Russia and the World: A Look into the Future.  * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to meet you in person. You have a busy programme in Moscow. Today, your visit gives us this excellent opportunity to declare the opening of the Year of Russia in Greece and the Year of Greece in Russia. These programmes will see more than 30 different events take place, nearly 40 in fact, 37 events in all. There will be Greek exhibitions at the Hermitage, at the Historical Museum in Moscow, Russian companies will take part in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, and we will organise a round table as part of the 20th St Petersburg International Economic Forum.  Mr President, it is a great pleasure to welcome to Moscow the head of state of Greece, a friendly country with which we share unique historical ties. Welcome!  President of Greece Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for your hospitality and for this reception. I thank you too for the fact that our meeting effectively opens the Year of Greece in Russia and the Year of Russia in Greece. The planned events can and will build closer ties between our close and friendly peoples.  I think that this year will bring us the pleasure of having the opportunity to receive you in Athens. It is your turn to come to Athens now. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Prokopis Pavlopoulos: Mr President, on behalf of the Greek people, the Greek government, and all democratic forces in Greece, I want to say that we value most highly Russia\\u2019s contribution to resolving the world\\u2019s current problems and confronting challenges that are not so much economic as humanitarian in nature.  I believe that no matter what the differences between Russia and the European Union, they can be resolved through dialogue. I think that no matter what these differences may be, they are of little significance compared to the challenges we face at the global level: the need to end the war in the Middle East, in Syria, restore peace, protect people, fight terrorism, which threatens the entire international community, and defeat ISIS.  <\\u2026>\",\n          \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party\\u2019s plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party\\u2019s multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party\\u2019s concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people\\u2019s programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people\\u2019s incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress\\u2019 previous stages.  I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments.  Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people\\u2019s programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people\\u2019s current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them.  I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party\\u2019s local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people\\u2019s safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia\\u2019s sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children.  I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle.  We stand together for Russia.\",\n          \"The President\\u2019s participation in the Congress was not planned, but, as Vladimir Putin said addressing the forum participants, he found it necessary to clarify the national leadership\\u2019s position on these important issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, This is an unusual event, an unusual forum: the Russian Congress of Parents. All of us are parents, at least the majority of Russians are. I understand that today we have a meeting of the core group of parents. Your agenda includes a number of issues that have great importance to our society. I just came in and was told that Mr Kurginyan spoke before me and his speech was very emotional. This is understandable because these issues are very acute and they concern everyone. I thought it was my duty to meet with you and explain my own position on these issues, the position of the country\\u2019s leadership. Especially since I have received a petition, which was addressed to me personally and signed by 141,000 people. I am sure that there would have been even more signatories if everyone interested in this issue had the opportunity to sign the petition. People are truly concerned about and opposed to some mechanisms that are part of the juvenile justice system. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the draft laws proposing direct or indirect regulation of relations between parents and children, as well as special legal mechanisms regarding work with minors. I think everybody realises that it would be wrong to leave absolutely everything as it is. We must move forward, utilise modern techniques that are used in other countries but this should be done very carefully. I would like to say a few words about this issue. This concerns two laws. The first was submitted by the President in March 2012, and the second by the Government on September 25, 2012. As I understand it, those are the laws in question. I would like to make a few points in this regard. First. Public opinion will certainly be heard and taken into account. In these matters, in adopting such laws, there is no room for secrecy or forcing unwanted legislation on society. I would go even further: this applies to all government decisions, or at least that is how it should be. Second, I agree that a number of the draft laws\\u2019 provisions on foster care and control over orphans\\u2019 rights, may be ambiguous and contain explicit social risks. Most importantly, they do not take Russian family traditions fully into account. Russia is a very big country with great ethnic and cultural diversity. There are some regions, for example, the Northern Caucasus (I see representatives of the Northern Caucasus here), where child homelessness and abandonment are historically unknown. Russians and almost all the peoples of Russia have centuries-old traditions of a big family, which unites several generations. Care for the elderly and the children always had special importance. We must revive these traditions, while at the same time making every effort to avoid blindly copying other cultures\\u2019 experience. This is because the management models of social phenomena are controversial in these spheres and in those countries where the rules of juvenile justice are most widely applied. There are some advantages and great many disadvantages. Incidentally, the general public is aware of these disadvantages as experienced by Russian families living abroad. There are many examples where normal, loving and hard-working parents lose custody of their children. Some cases of interference in family life are just absurd and make a mockery of justice. An ill-considered introduction of such mechanisms can lead to the violation of family sovereignty, cause distrust and discord between parents and children, and even outright corruption, when some unscrupulous officials take advantage of such situations. Certainly, we must and will listen to your opinions. I want to assure you of that. Draft laws must be subjected to the most thorough public debate and can only be adopted \\u2013 if they are adopted at all \\u2013 in the event that consensus can be reached on their main provisions. Only then will a draft law\\u2019s sound provisions designed to support families and children gain strong public support. Family law is a very sensitive area. The laws regulating the relationship between parents and children should contain only the most unambiguous and clear language, eliminating bureaucratic abuses and multiple interpretations. The legal drafting methodology must be perfected until it is as good as it can be. In particular, there must be a strict and exhaustive list of signs of extreme distress within a family, when the authorities can and must intervene and provide targeted assistance. Sometimes the situation calls for urgent action on the part of the state, especially when the rights and even the life of a child are at stake. I am sure you will agree with me that intervention in such cases is necessary. Naturally, each case is different and every detail must be taken into account. It is essential not only to act resolutely but also, most importantly, with utmost sensitivity. An impersonal, formal approach must be avoided at all cost and every effort must be made to keep the family together and provide it the support it needs. Success of the efforts for prosperous, secure children\\u2019s lives should not be measured by the number of cases when parents lose custody of their children. That is not the yardstick we should use. On the contrary, the loss of custody is very problematic solution and should be used as a last resort. Sometimes it can be just a dead end. It is an intentional or unintentional destruction of the traditional Russian family, and a strong and happy family cannot be replaced by any law or government oversight agency. That much is certain. What is far more important is to remove the causes of social ills. Of course, this requires long-term systemic efforts that are far more demanding. We must pay constant attention to families, especially those that find themselves in difficult situations; we must work with parents who refuse to bring up their children, provide timely psychological and other assistance to pregnant women who have doubts about their ability to raise the child alone. We have a well-developed legal system and normative base, both our own and international, which we have joined. Russia is party to a number of international legal instruments. We must use this to our advantage and increase these instruments\\u2019 effectiveness. However, I would like to touch on another very important issue: support for the institution of adoption. We must do everything we can to make sure that orphans are adopted by families in their own country, in Russia. You are all aware of the executive order signed at the end of December 2012. The Government was issued instructions to simplify adoption, guardianship and foster care procedures for orphaned and abandoned children, and to take measures to provide tax benefits for the adoptive and foster families, increase the lump sum payments families are entitled to when they adopt a child and the benefits paid to disabled children and persons with class I disabilities from childhood. All these measures will add up to tangible support for our citizens who decide to take in a child from an orphanage. Perhaps we will find other effective support measures with your help. Surveys show that there are more and more people like that, including people wishing to adopt including disabled children and children with special needs. I want to stress that Russian families that adopt children should receive support not only from the state but also from the whole society. Here, we look forward to your active contribution and support. The family must be in the centre of public attention and we should see the family as our national heritage. Since occasions like this are rare, I would like to raise another matter. It is not directly related to the family or the draft laws you have met here to discuss, but your agenda will probably expand to include other issues. It has to do with child education and work with children, and one aspect seems to me particularly important in this regard, especially since it is surrounded by the same special, increased attention from society. I am talking about a standard literature curriculum. As you know, the new curriculum has indeed provoked considerable debate. I share the opinion that some new authors have replaced some works of literature that make up the historical heritage of our country. By the way, I think it is good that there are new authors. True, not everyone shares their political views or the subject matter of their writing. Even so, modern Russian literature is part of world literature, and I believe that we should treat it with respect. However, when the school curriculum excludes Kuprin, Leskov and Alexei Tolstoi, Pushkin\\u2019s The Bronze Horseman, Chekhov\\u2019s The Lady with a Dog or The Man in a Case, and poems by Akhmadulina, Vysotsky and Okudzhava, the question immediately arises: why has this happened and what has replaced them? Let me express a view that may be controversial and perhaps many of you will not agree with me, but I think even serious works of literature may sometimes have obscene language or contain scenes that readers may find shocking, but should such books be part of the compulsory curriculum at school \\u2013 that is the question. I agree with those who question this decision. I believe that the authors of the new literature curriculum should pay attention to criticism, especially since many comments are reasonable, as I have said. Therefore, I expect that the relevant agencies will draw certain conclusions. Friends, I am sure that the people who have met here today are true patriots of our country, true patriots of Russia. This is evidenced by your strong feelings and proactive approach to the events taking place in our country. We can only support your desire to contribute to its successful development. We are grateful for and unconditionally support your concern for the family and the increasing role of patriotic values and civic consciousness in the education of our children. You should have no doubt about it. I am confident that this forum, which brought together like-minded people from many Russian regions, will generate new and exciting ideas that will be needed and realised. We are ready for close partnership and collaboration. I wish you fruitful deliberations. Thank you very much for your position.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"place\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 814,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Lisbon\",\n          \"Cyprus\",\n          \"Alushta\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7548,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Meeting on socioeconomic development of Crimea and Sevastopol\",\n          \"Extracts from a Speech to the Second Poland-Russia Economic Forum\",\n          \"Leaders Summit on Climate\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"no_contract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"transcript_unfiltered_str\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9619,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The subjects of discussion covered bilateral relations, including organisation of the Year of Russia in Greece and Year of Greece in Russia in 2016, and current international affairs. Mr Pavlopoulos Pavlopoulos ProkopisPresident of Greece arrived in Moscow to take part in the forum Russia and the World: A Look into the Future. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to meet you in person. You have a busy programme in Moscow. Today, your visit gives us this excellent opportunity to declare the opening of the Year of Russia in Greece and the Year of Greece in Russia. These programmes will see more than 30 different events take place, nearly 40 in fact, 37 events in all. There will be Greek exhibitions at the Hermitage, at the Historical Museum in Moscow, Russian companies will take part in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, and we will organise a round table as part of the 20th St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Mr President, it is a great pleasure to welcome to Moscow the head of state of Greece, a friendly country with which we share unique historical ties. Welcome! President of Greece Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for your hospitality and for this reception. I thank you too for the fact that our meeting effectively opens the Year of Greece in Russia and the Year of Russia in Greece. The planned events can and will build closer ties between our close and friendly peoples. I think that this year will bring us the pleasure of having the opportunity to receive you in Athens. It is your turn to come to Athens now. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Prokopis Pavlopoulos: Mr President, on behalf of the Greek people, the Greek government, and all democratic forces in Greece, I want to say that we value most highly Russia\\u2019s contribution to resolving the world\\u2019s current problems and confronting challenges that are not so much economic as humanitarian in nature. I believe that no matter what the differences between Russia and the European Union, they can be resolved through dialogue. I think that no matter what these differences may be, they are of little significance compared to the challenges we face at the global level: the need to end the war in the Middle East, in Syria, restore peace, protect people, fight terrorism, which threatens the entire international community, and defeat ISIS. <\\u2026>\",\n          \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party\\u2019s plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party\\u2019s multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party\\u2019s concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people\\u2019s programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people\\u2019s incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress\\u2019 previous stages. I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments. Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people\\u2019s programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people\\u2019s current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them. I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party\\u2019s local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people\\u2019s safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia\\u2019s sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children. I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle. We stand together for Russia.\",\n          \"The President\\u2019s participation in the Congress was not planned, but, as Vladimir Putin said addressing the forum participants, he found it necessary to clarify the national leadership\\u2019s position on these important issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, This is an unusual event, an unusual forum: the Russian Congress of Parents. All of us are parents, at least the majority of Russians are. I understand that today we have a meeting of the core group of parents. Your agenda includes a number of issues that have great importance to our society. I just came in and was told that Mr Kurginyan spoke before me and his speech was very emotional. This is understandable because these issues are very acute and they concern everyone. I thought it was my duty to meet with you and explain my own position on these issues, the position of the country\\u2019s leadership. Especially since I have received a petition, which was addressed to me personally and signed by 141,000 people. I am sure that there would have been even more signatories if everyone interested in this issue had the opportunity to sign the petition. People are truly concerned about and opposed to some mechanisms that are part of the juvenile justice system. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the draft laws proposing direct or indirect regulation of relations between parents and children, as well as special legal mechanisms regarding work with minors. I think everybody realises that it would be wrong to leave absolutely everything as it is. We must move forward, utilise modern techniques that are used in other countries but this should be done very carefully. I would like to say a few words about this issue. This concerns two laws. The first was submitted by the President in March 2012, and the second by the Government on September 25, 2012. As I understand it, those are the laws in question. I would like to make a few points in this regard. First. Public opinion will certainly be heard and taken into account. In these matters, in adopting such laws, there is no room for secrecy or forcing unwanted legislation on society. I would go even further: this applies to all government decisions, or at least that is how it should be. Second, I agree that a number of the draft laws\\u2019 provisions on foster care and control over orphans\\u2019 rights, may be ambiguous and contain explicit social risks. Most importantly, they do not take Russian family traditions fully into account. Russia is a very big country with great ethnic and cultural diversity. There are some regions, for example, the Northern Caucasus (I see representatives of the Northern Caucasus here), where child homelessness and abandonment are historically unknown. Russians and almost all the peoples of Russia have centuries-old traditions of a big family, which unites several generations. Care for the elderly and the children always had special importance. We must revive these traditions, while at the same time making every effort to avoid blindly copying other cultures\\u2019 experience. This is because the management models of social phenomena are controversial in these spheres and in those countries where the rules of juvenile justice are most widely applied. There are some advantages and great many disadvantages. Incidentally, the general public is aware of these disadvantages as experienced by Russian families living abroad. There are many examples where normal, loving and hard-working parents lose custody of their children. Some cases of interference in family life are just absurd and make a mockery of justice.

Mr Pavlopoulos     Pavlopoulos ProkopisPresident of Greece  arrived in Moscow to take part in the forum Russia and the World: A Look into the Future.  * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to meet you in person. You have a busy programme in Moscow. Today, your visit gives us this excellent opportunity to declare the opening of the Year of Russia in Greece and the Year of Greece in Russia. These programmes will see more than 30 different events take place, nearly 40 in fact, 37 events in all. There will be Greek exhibitions at the Hermitage, at the Historical Museum in Moscow, Russian companies will take part in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, and we will organise a round table as part of the 20th St Petersburg International Economic Forum.  Mr President, it is a great pleasure to welcome to Moscow the head of state of Greece, a friendly country with which we share unique historical ties. Welcome!  President of Greece Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for your hospitality and for this reception. I thank you too for the fact that our meeting effectively opens the Year of Greece in Russia and the Year of Russia in Greece. The planned events can and will build closer ties between our close and friendly peoples.  I think that this year will bring us the pleasure of having the opportunity to receive you in Athens. It is your turn to come to Athens now. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Prokopis Pavlopoulos: Mr President, on behalf of the Greek people, the Greek government, and all democratic forces in Greece, I want to say that we value most highly Russia\\u2019s contribution to resolving the world\\u2019s current problems and confronting challenges that are not so much economic as humanitarian in nature.  I believe that no matter what the differences between Russia and the European Union, they can be resolved through dialogue. I think that no matter what these differences may be, they are of little significance compared to the challenges we face at the global level: the need to end the war in the Middle East, in Syria, restore peace, protect people, fight terrorism, which threatens the entire international community, and defeat ISIS.  <\\u2026>\",\n          \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party\\u2019s plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party\\u2019s multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party\\u2019s concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people\\u2019s programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people\\u2019s incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress\\u2019 previous stages.  I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments.  Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people\\u2019s programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people\\u2019s current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them.  I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party\\u2019s local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people\\u2019s safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia\\u2019s sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children.  I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle.  We stand together for Russia.\",\n          \"The President\\u2019s participation in the Congress was not planned, but, as Vladimir Putin said addressing the forum participants, he found it necessary to clarify the national leadership\\u2019s position on these important issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, This is an unusual event, an unusual forum: the Russian Congress of Parents. All of us are parents, at least the majority of Russians are. I understand that today we have a meeting of the core group of parents. Your agenda includes a number of issues that have great importance to our society. I just came in and was told that Mr Kurginyan spoke before me and his speech was very emotional. This is understandable because these issues are very acute and they concern everyone. I thought it was my duty to meet with you and explain my own position on these issues, the position of the country\\u2019s leadership. Especially since I have received a petition, which was addressed to me personally and signed by 141,000 people. I am sure that there would have been even more signatories if everyone interested in this issue had the opportunity to sign the petition. People are truly concerned about and opposed to some mechanisms that are part of the juvenile justice system. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the draft laws proposing direct or indirect regulation of relations between parents and children, as well as special legal mechanisms regarding work with minors. I think everybody realises that it would be wrong to leave absolutely everything as it is. We must move forward, utilise modern techniques that are used in other countries but this should be done very carefully. I would like to say a few words about this issue. This concerns two laws. The first was submitted by the President in March 2012, and the second by the Government on September 25, 2012. As I understand it, those are the laws in question. I would like to make a few points in this regard. First. Public opinion will certainly be heard and taken into account. In these matters, in adopting such laws, there is no room for secrecy or forcing unwanted legislation on society. I would go even further: this applies to all government decisions, or at least that is how it should be. Second, I agree that a number of the draft laws\\u2019 provisions on foster care and control over orphans\\u2019 rights, may be ambiguous and contain explicit social risks. Most importantly, they do not take Russian family traditions fully into account. Russia is a very big country with great ethnic and cultural diversity. There are some regions, for example, the Northern Caucasus (I see representatives of the Northern Caucasus here), where child homelessness and abandonment are historically unknown. Russians and almost all the peoples of Russia have centuries-old traditions of a big family, which unites several generations. Care for the elderly and the children always had special importance. We must revive these traditions, while at the same time making every effort to avoid blindly copying other cultures\\u2019 experience. This is because the management models of social phenomena are controversial in these spheres and in those countries where the rules of juvenile justice are most widely applied. There are some advantages and great many disadvantages. Incidentally, the general public is aware of these disadvantages as experienced by Russian families living abroad. There are many examples where normal, loving and hard-working parents lose custody of their children. Some cases of interference in family life are just absurd and make a mockery of justice. An ill-considered introduction of such mechanisms can lead to the violation of family sovereignty, cause distrust and discord between parents and children, and even outright corruption, when some unscrupulous officials take advantage of such situations. Certainly, we must and will listen to your opinions. I want to assure you of that. Draft laws must be subjected to the most thorough public debate and can only be adopted \\u2013 if they are adopted at all \\u2013 in the event that consensus can be reached on their main provisions. Only then will a draft law\\u2019s sound provisions designed to support families and children gain strong public support. Family law is a very sensitive area. The laws regulating the relationship between parents and children should contain only the most unambiguous and clear language, eliminating bureaucratic abuses and multiple interpretations. The legal drafting methodology must be perfected until it is as good as it can be. In particular, there must be a strict and exhaustive list of signs of extreme distress within a family, when the authorities can and must intervene and provide targeted assistance. Sometimes the situation calls for urgent action on the part of the state, especially when the rights and even the life of a child are at stake. I am sure you will agree with me that intervention in such cases is necessary. Naturally, each case is different and every detail must be taken into account. It is essential not only to act resolutely but also, most importantly, with utmost sensitivity. An impersonal, formal approach must be avoided at all cost and every effort must be made to keep the family together and provide it the support it needs. Success of the efforts for prosperous, secure children\\u2019s lives should not be measured by the number of cases when parents lose custody of their children. That is not the yardstick we should use. On the contrary, the loss of custody is very problematic solution and should be used as a last resort. Sometimes it can be just a dead end. It is an intentional or unintentional destruction of the traditional Russian family, and a strong and happy family cannot be replaced by any law or government oversight agency. That much is certain. What is far more important is to remove the causes of social ills. Of course, this requires long-term systemic efforts that are far more demanding. We must pay constant attention to families, especially those that find themselves in difficult situations; we must work with parents who refuse to bring up their children, provide timely psychological and other assistance to pregnant women who have doubts about their ability to raise the child alone. We have a well-developed legal system and normative base, both our own and international, which we have joined. Russia is party to a number of international legal instruments. We must use this to our advantage and increase these instruments\\u2019 effectiveness. However, I would like to touch on another very important issue: support for the institution of adoption. We must do everything we can to make sure that orphans are adopted by families in their own country, in Russia. You are all aware of the executive order signed at the end of December 2012. The Government was issued instructions to simplify adoption, guardianship and foster care procedures for orphaned and abandoned children, and to take measures to provide tax benefits for the adoptive and foster families, increase the lump sum payments families are entitled to when they adopt a child and the benefits paid to disabled children and persons with class I disabilities from childhood. All these measures will add up to tangible support for our citizens who decide to take in a child from an orphanage. Perhaps we will find other effective support measures with your help. Surveys show that there are more and more people like that, including people wishing to adopt including disabled children and children with special needs. I want to stress that Russian families that adopt children should receive support not only from the state but also from the whole society. Here, we look forward to your active contribution and support. The family must be in the centre of public attention and we should see the family as our national heritage. Since occasions like this are rare, I would like to raise another matter. It is not directly related to the family or the draft laws you have met here to discuss, but your agenda will probably expand to include other issues. It has to do with child education and work with children, and one aspect seems to me particularly important in this regard, especially since it is surrounded by the same special, increased attention from society. I am talking about a standard literature curriculum. As you know, the new curriculum has indeed provoked considerable debate. I share the opinion that some new authors have replaced some works of literature that make up the historical heritage of our country. By the way, I think it is good that there are new authors. True, not everyone shares their political views or the subject matter of their writing. Even so, modern Russian literature is part of world literature, and I believe that we should treat it with respect. However, when the school curriculum excludes Kuprin, Leskov and Alexei Tolstoi, Pushkin\\u2019s The Bronze Horseman, Chekhov\\u2019s The Lady with a Dog or The Man in a Case, and poems by Akhmadulina, Vysotsky and Okudzhava, the question immediately arises: why has this happened and what has replaced them? Let me express a view that may be controversial and perhaps many of you will not agree with me, but I think even serious works of literature may sometimes have obscene language or contain scenes that readers may find shocking, but should such books be part of the compulsory curriculum at school \\u2013 that is the question. I agree with those who question this decision. I believe that the authors of the new literature curriculum should pay attention to criticism, especially since many comments are reasonable, as I have said. Therefore, I expect that the relevant agencies will draw certain conclusions. Friends, I am sure that the people who have met here today are true patriots of our country, true patriots of Russia. This is evidenced by your strong feelings and proactive approach to the events taking place in our country. We can only support your desire to contribute to its successful development. We are grateful for and unconditionally support your concern for the family and the increasing role of patriotic values and civic consciousness in the education of our children. You should have no doubt about it. I am confident that this forum, which brought together like-minded people from many Russian regions, will generate new and exciting ideas that will be needed and realised. We are ready for close partnership and collaboration. I wish you fruitful deliberations. Thank you very much for your position.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"place\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 814,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Lisbon\",\n          \"Cyprus\",\n          \"Alushta\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7548,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Meeting on socioeconomic development of Crimea and Sevastopol\",\n          \"Extracts from a Speech to the Second Poland-Russia Economic Forum\",\n          \"Leaders Summit on Climate\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"no_contract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"transcript_unfiltered_str\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9619,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The subjects of discussion covered bilateral relations, including organisation of the Year of Russia in Greece and Year of Greece in Russia in 2016, and current international affairs. Mr Pavlopoulos Pavlopoulos ProkopisPresident of Greece arrived in Moscow to take part in the forum Russia and the World: A Look into the Future. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to meet you in person. You have a busy programme in Moscow. Today, your visit gives us this excellent opportunity to declare the opening of the Year of Russia in Greece and the Year of Greece in Russia. These programmes will see more than 30 different events take place, nearly 40 in fact, 37 events in all. There will be Greek exhibitions at the Hermitage, at the Historical Museum in Moscow, Russian companies will take part in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, and we will organise a round table as part of the 20th St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Mr President, it is a great pleasure to welcome to Moscow the head of state of Greece, a friendly country with which we share unique historical ties. Welcome! President of Greece Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for your hospitality and for this reception. I thank you too for the fact that our meeting effectively opens the Year of Greece in Russia and the Year of Russia in Greece. The planned events can and will build closer ties between our close and friendly peoples. I think that this year will bring us the pleasure of having the opportunity to receive you in Athens. It is your turn to come to Athens now. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Prokopis Pavlopoulos: Mr President, on behalf of the Greek people, the Greek government, and all democratic forces in Greece, I want to say that we value most highly Russia\\u2019s contribution to resolving the world\\u2019s current problems and confronting challenges that are not so much economic as humanitarian in nature. I believe that no matter what the differences between Russia and the European Union, they can be resolved through dialogue. I think that no matter what these differences may be, they are of little significance compared to the challenges we face at the global level: the need to end the war in the Middle East, in Syria, restore peace, protect people, fight terrorism, which threatens the entire international community, and defeat ISIS. <\\u2026>\",\n          \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party\\u2019s plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party\\u2019s multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party\\u2019s concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people\\u2019s programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people\\u2019s incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress\\u2019 previous stages. I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments. Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people\\u2019s programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people\\u2019s current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them. I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party\\u2019s local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people\\u2019s safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia\\u2019s sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children. I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle. We stand together for Russia.\",\n          \"The President\\u2019s participation in the Congress was not planned, but, as Vladimir Putin said addressing the forum participants, he found it necessary to clarify the national leadership\\u2019s position on these important issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, This is an unusual event, an unusual forum: the Russian Congress of Parents. All of us are parents, at least the majority of Russians are. I understand that today we have a meeting of the core group of parents. Your agenda includes a number of issues that have great importance to our society. I just came in and was told that Mr Kurginyan spoke before me and his speech was very emotional. This is understandable because these issues are very acute and they concern everyone. I thought it was my duty to meet with you and explain my own position on these issues, the position of the country\\u2019s leadership. Especially since I have received a petition, which was addressed to me personally and signed by 141,000 people. I am sure that there would have been even more signatories if everyone interested in this issue had the opportunity to sign the petition. People are truly concerned about and opposed to some mechanisms that are part of the juvenile justice system. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the draft laws proposing direct or indirect regulation of relations between parents and children, as well as special legal mechanisms regarding work with minors. I think everybody realises that it would be wrong to leave absolutely everything as it is. We must move forward, utilise modern techniques that are used in other countries but this should be done very carefully. I would like to say a few words about this issue. This concerns two laws. The first was submitted by the President in March 2012, and the second by the Government on September 25, 2012. As I understand it, those are the laws in question. I would like to make a few points in this regard. First. Public opinion will certainly be heard and taken into account. In these matters, in adopting such laws, there is no room for secrecy or forcing unwanted legislation on society. I would go even further: this applies to all government decisions, or at least that is how it should be. Second, I agree that a number of the draft laws\\u2019 provisions on foster care and control over orphans\\u2019 rights, may be ambiguous and contain explicit social risks. Most importantly, they do not take Russian family traditions fully into account. Russia is a very big country with great ethnic and cultural diversity. There are some regions, for example, the Northern Caucasus (I see representatives of the Northern Caucasus here), where child homelessness and abandonment are historically unknown. Russians and almost all the peoples of Russia have centuries-old traditions of a big family, which unites several generations. Care for the elderly and the children always had special importance. We must revive these traditions, while at the same time making every effort to avoid blindly copying other cultures\\u2019 experience. This is because the management models of social phenomena are controversial in these spheres and in those countries where the rules of juvenile justice are most widely applied. There are some advantages and great many disadvantages. Incidentally, the general public is aware of these disadvantages as experienced by Russian families living abroad. There are many examples where normal, loving and hard-working parents lose custody of their children. Some cases of interference in family life are just absurd and make a mockery of justice. An ill-considered introduction of such mechanisms can lead to the violation of family sovereignty, because distrust and discord between parents and children, and even outright corruption, when some unscrupulous officials take advantage of such situations. Certainly, we must and will listen to your opinions. I want to assure you of that. Draft laws must be subjected to the most thorough public debate and can only be adopted \\u2013 if they are adopted at all \\u2013 in the event that consensus can be reached on their main provisions. Only then will a draft law\\u2019s sound provisions designed to support families and children gain strong public support. Family law is a very sensitive area. The laws regulating the relationship between parents and children should contain only the most unambiguous and clear language, eliminating bureaucratic abuses and multiple interpretations. The legal drafting methodology must be perfected until it is as good as it can be.

Mr Pavlopoulos     Pavlopoulos ProkopisPresident of Greece  arrived in Moscow to take part in the forum Russia and the World: A Look into the Future.  * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to meet you in person. You have a busy programme in Moscow. Today, your visit gives us this excellent opportunity to declare the opening of the Year of Russia in Greece and the Year of Greece in Russia. These programmes will see more than 30 different events take place, nearly 40 in fact, 37 events in all. There will be Greek exhibitions at the Hermitage, at the Historical Museum in Moscow, Russian companies will take part in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, and we will organise a round table as part of the 20th St Petersburg International Economic Forum.  Mr President, it is a great pleasure to welcome to Moscow the head of state of Greece, a friendly country with which we share unique historical ties. Welcome!  President of Greece Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for your hospitality and for this reception. I thank you too for the fact that our meeting effectively opens the Year of Greece in Russia and the Year of Russia in Greece. The planned events can and will build closer ties between our close and friendly peoples.  I think that this year will bring us the pleasure of having the opportunity to receive you in Athens. It is your turn to come to Athens now. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Prokopis Pavlopoulos: Mr President, on behalf of the Greek people, the Greek government, and all democratic forces in Greece, I want to say that we value most highly Russia\\u2019s contribution to resolving the world\\u2019s current problems and confronting challenges that are not so much economic as humanitarian in nature.  I believe that no matter what the differences between Russia and the European Union, they can be resolved through dialogue. I think that no matter what these differences may be, they are of little significance compared to the challenges we face at the global level: the need to end the war in the Middle East, in Syria, restore peace, protect people, fight terrorism, which threatens the entire international community, and defeat ISIS.  <\\u2026>\",\n          \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party\\u2019s plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party\\u2019s multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party\\u2019s concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people\\u2019s programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people\\u2019s incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress\\u2019 previous stages.  I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments.  Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people\\u2019s programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people\\u2019s current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them.  I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party\\u2019s local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people\\u2019s safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia\\u2019s sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children.  I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle.  We stand together for Russia.\",\n          \"The President\\u2019s participation in the Congress was not planned, but, as Vladimir Putin said addressing the forum participants, he found it necessary to clarify the national leadership\\u2019s position on these important issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, This is an unusual event, an unusual forum: the Russian Congress of Parents. All of us are parents, at least the majority of Russians are. I understand that today we have a meeting of the core group of parents. Your agenda includes a number of issues that have great importance to our society. I just came in and was told that Mr Kurginyan spoke before me and his speech was very emotional. This is understandable because these issues are very acute and they concern everyone. I thought it was my duty to meet with you and explain my own position on these issues, the position of the country\\u2019s leadership. Especially since I have received a petition, which was addressed to me personally and signed by 141,000 people. I am sure that there would have been even more signatories if everyone interested in this issue had the opportunity to sign the petition. People are truly concerned about and opposed to some mechanisms that are part of the juvenile justice system. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the draft laws proposing direct or indirect regulation of relations between parents and children, as well as special legal mechanisms regarding work with minors. I think everybody realises that it would be wrong to leave absolutely everything as it is. We must move forward, utilise modern techniques that are used in other countries but this should be done very carefully. I would like to say a few words about this issue. This concerns two laws. The first was submitted by the President in March 2012, and the second by the Government on September 25, 2012. As I understand it, those are the laws in question. I would like to make a few points in this regard. First. Public opinion will certainly be heard and taken into account. In these matters, in adopting such laws, there is no room for secrecy or forcing unwanted legislation on society. I would go even further: this applies to all government decisions, or at least that is how it should be. Second, I agree that a number of the draft laws\\u2019 provisions on foster care and control over orphans\\u2019 rights, may be ambiguous and contain explicit social risks. Most importantly, they do not take Russian family traditions fully into account. Russia is a very big country with great ethnic and cultural diversity. There are some regions, for example, the Northern Caucasus (I see representatives of the Northern Caucasus here), where child homelessness and abandonment are historically unknown. Russians and almost all the peoples of Russia have centuries-old traditions of a big family, which unites several generations. Care for the elderly and the children always had special importance. We must revive these traditions, while at the same time making every effort to avoid blindly copying other cultures\\u2019 experience. This is because the management models of social phenomena are controversial in these spheres and in those countries where the rules of juvenile justice are most widely applied. There are some advantages and great many disadvantages. Incidentally, the general public is aware of these disadvantages as experienced by Russian families living abroad. There are many examples where normal, loving and hard-working parents lose custody of their children. Some cases of interference in family life are just absurd and make a mockery of justice. An ill-considered introduction of such mechanisms can lead to the violation of family sovereignty, cause distrust and discord between parents and children, and even outright corruption, when some unscrupulous officials take advantage of such situations. Certainly, we must and will listen to your opinions. I want to assure you of that. Draft laws must be subjected to the most thorough public debate and can only be adopted \\u2013 if they are adopted at all \\u2013 in the event that consensus can be reached on their main provisions. Only then will a draft law\\u2019s sound provisions designed to support families and children gain strong public support. Family law is a very sensitive area. The laws regulating the relationship between parents and children should contain only the most unambiguous and clear language, eliminating bureaucratic abuses and multiple interpretations. The legal drafting methodology must be perfected until it is as good as it can be. In particular, there must be a strict and exhaustive list of signs of extreme distress within a family, when the authorities can and must intervene and provide targeted assistance. Sometimes the situation calls for urgent action on the part of the state, especially when the rights and even the life of a child are at stake. I am sure you will agree with me that intervention in such cases is necessary. Naturally, each case is different and every detail must be taken into account. It is essential not only to act resolutely but also, most importantly, with utmost sensitivity. An impersonal, formal approach must be avoided at all cost and every effort must be made to keep the family together and provide it the support it needs. Success of the efforts for prosperous, secure children\\u2019s lives should not be measured by the number of cases when parents lose custody of their children. That is not the yardstick we should use. On the contrary, the loss of custody is very problematic solution and should be used as a last resort. Sometimes it can be just a dead end. It is an intentional or unintentional destruction of the traditional Russian family, and a strong and happy family cannot be replaced by any law or government oversight agency. That much is certain. What is far more important is to remove the causes of social ills. Of course, this requires long-term systemic efforts that are far more demanding. We must pay constant attention to families, especially those that find themselves in difficult situations; we must work with parents who refuse to bring up their children, provide timely psychological and other assistance to pregnant women who have doubts about their ability to raise the child alone. We have a well-developed legal system and normative base, both our own and international, which we have joined. Russia is party to a number of international legal instruments. We must use this to our advantage and increase these instruments\\u2019 effectiveness. However, I would like to touch on another very important issue: support for the institution of adoption. We must do everything we can to make sure that orphans are adopted by families in their own country, in Russia. You are all aware of the executive order signed at the end of December 2012. The Government was issued instructions to simplify adoption, guardianship and foster care procedures for orphaned and abandoned children, and to take measures to provide tax benefits for the adoptive and foster families, increase the lump sum payments families are entitled to when they adopt a child and the benefits paid to disabled children and persons with class I disabilities from childhood. All these measures will add up to tangible support for our citizens who decide to take in a child from an orphanage. Perhaps we will find other effective support measures with your help. Surveys show that there are more and more people like that, including people wishing to adopt including disabled children and children with special needs. I want to stress that Russian families that adopt children should receive support not only from the state but also from the whole society. Here, we look forward to your active contribution and support. The family must be in the centre of public attention and we should see the family as our national heritage. Since occasions like this are rare, I would like to raise another matter. It is not directly related to the family or the draft laws you have met here to discuss, but your agenda will probably expand to include other issues. It has to do with child education and work with children, and one aspect seems to me particularly important in this regard, especially since it is surrounded by the same special, increased attention from society. I am talking about a standard literature curriculum. As you know, the new curriculum has indeed provoked considerable debate. I share the opinion that some new authors have replaced some works of literature that make up the historical heritage of our country. By the way, I think it is good that there are new authors. True, not everyone shares their political views or the subject matter of their writing. Even so, modern Russian literature is part of world literature, and I believe that we should treat it with respect. However, when the school curriculum excludes Kuprin, Leskov and Alexei Tolstoi, Pushkin\\u2019s The Bronze Horseman, Chekhov\\u2019s The Lady with a Dog or The Man in a Case, and poems by Akhmadulina, Vysotsky and Okudzhava, the question immediately arises: why has this happened and what has replaced them? Let me express a view that may be controversial and perhaps many of you will not agree with me, but I think even serious works of literature may sometimes have obscene language or contain scenes that readers may find shocking, but should such books be part of the compulsory curriculum at school \\u2013 that is the question. I agree with those who question this decision. I believe that the authors of the new literature curriculum should pay attention to criticism, especially since many comments are reasonable, as I have said. Therefore, I expect that the relevant agencies will draw certain conclusions. Friends, I am sure that the people who have met here today are true patriots of our country, true patriots of Russia. This is evidenced by your strong feelings and proactive approach to the events taking place in our country. We can only support your desire to contribute to its successful development. We are grateful for and unconditionally support your concern for the family and the increasing role of patriotic values and civic consciousness in the education of our children. You should have no doubt about it. I am confident that this forum, which brought together like-minded people from many Russian regions, will generate new and exciting ideas that will be needed and realised. We are ready for close partnership and collaboration. I wish you fruitful deliberations.

Mr Pavlopoulos Pavlopoulos ProkopisPresident of Greece arrived in Moscow to take part in the forum Russia and the World: A Look into the Future. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to meet you in person. You have a busy programme in Moscow. Today, your visit gives us this excellent opportunity to declare the opening of the Year of Russia in Greece and the Year of Greece in Russia. These programmes will see more than 30 different events take place, nearly 40 in fact, 37 events in all. There will be Greek exhibitions at the Hermitage, at the Historical Museum in Moscow, Russian companies will take part in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, and we will organise a round table as part of the 20th St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Mr President, it is a great pleasure to welcome to Moscow the head of state of Greece, a friendly country with which we share unique historical ties. Welcome! President of Greece Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for your hospitality and for this reception. I thank you too for the fact that our meeting effectively opens the Year of Greece in Russia and the Year of Russia in Greece. The planned events can and will build closer ties between our close and friendly peoples. I think that this year will bring us the pleasure of having the opportunity to receive you in Athens. It is your turn to come to Athens now. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Prokopis Pavlopoulos: Mr President, on behalf of the Greek people, the Greek government, and all democratic forces in Greece, I want to say that we value most highly Russia\\u2019s contribution to resolving the world\\u2019s current problems and confronting challenges that are not so much economic as humanitarian in nature. I believe that no matter what the differences between Russia and the European Union, they can be resolved through dialogue. I think that no matter what these differences may be, they are of little significance compared to the challenges we face at the global level: the need to end the war in the Middle East, in Syria, restore peace, protect people, fight terrorism, which threatens the entire international community, and defeat ISIS. <\\u2026>\",\n          \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party\\u2019s plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party\\u2019s multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party\\u2019s concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people\\u2019s programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people\\u2019s incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress\\u2019 previous stages. I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments. Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people\\u2019s programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people\\u2019s current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them. I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party\\u2019s local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people\\u2019s safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia\\u2019s sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children. I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle. We stand together for Russia.\",\n          \"The President\\u2019s participation in the Congress was not planned, but, as Vladimir Putin said addressing the forum participants, he found it necessary to clarify the national leadership\\u2019s position on these important issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, This is an unusual event, an unusual forum: the Russian Congress of Parents. All of us are parents, at least the majority of Russians are. I understand that today we have a meeting of the core group of parents. Your agenda includes a number of issues that have great importance to our society. I just came in and was told that Mr Kurginyan spoke before me and his speech was very emotional. This is understandable because these issues are very acute and they concern everyone. I thought it was my duty to meet with you and explain my own position on these issues, the position of the country\\u2019s leadership. Especially since I have received a petition, which was addressed to me personally and signed by 141,000 people. I am sure that there would have been even more signatories if everyone interested in this issue had the opportunity to sign the petition. People are truly concerned about and opposed to some mechanisms that are part of the juvenile justice system. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the draft laws proposing direct or indirect regulation of relations between parents and children, as well as special legal mechanisms regarding work with minors. I think everybody realises that it would be wrong to leave absolutely everything as it is. We must move forward, utilise modern techniques that are used in other countries but this should be done very carefully. I would like to say a few words about this issue. This concerns two laws. The first was submitted by the President in March 2012, and the second by the Government on September 25, 2012. As I understand it, those are the laws in question. I would like to make a few points in this regard. First. Public opinion will certainly be heard and taken into account. In these matters, in adopting such laws, there is no room for secrecy or forcing unwanted legislation on society. I would go even further: this applies to all government decisions, or at least that is how it should be. Second, I agree that a number of the draft laws\\u2019 provisions on foster care and control over orphans\\u2019 rights, may be ambiguous and contain explicit social risks. Most importantly, they do not take Russian family traditions fully into account. Russia is a very big country with great ethnic and cultural diversity. There are some regions, for example, the Northern Caucasus (I see representatives of the Northern Caucasus here), where child homelessness and abandonment are historically unknown. Russians and almost all the peoples of Russia have centuries-old traditions of a big family, which unites several generations. Care for the elderly and the children always had special importance. We must revive these traditions, while at the same time making every effort to avoid blindly copying other cultures\\u2019 experience. This is because the management models of social phenomena are controversial in these spheres and in those countries where the rules of juvenile justice are most widely applied. There are some advantages and great many disadvantages. Incidentally, the general public is aware of these disadvantages as experienced by Russian families living abroad. There are many examples where normal, loving and hard-working parents lose custody of their children. Some cases of interference in family life are just absurd and make a mockery of justice. An ill-considered introduction of such mechanisms can lead to the violation of family sovereignty, because distrust and discord between parents and children, and even outright corruption, when some unscrupulous officials take advantage of such situations. Certainly, we must and will listen to your opinions. I want to assure you of that. Draft laws must be subjected to the most thorough public debate and can only be adopted \\u2013 if they are adopted at all \\u2013 in the event that consensus can be reached on their main provisions. Only then will a draft law\\u2019s sound provisions designed to support families and children gain strong public support. Family law is a very sensitive area. The laws regulating the relationship between parents and children should contain only the most unambiguous and clear language, eliminating bureaucratic abuses and multiple interpretations. The legal drafting methodology must be perfected until it is as good as it can be. In particular, there must be a strict and exhaustive list of signs of extreme distress within a family, when the authorities can and must intervene and provide targeted assistance. Sometimes the situation calls for urgent action on the part of the state, especially when the rights and even the life of a child are at stake. I am sure you will agree with me that intervention in such cases is necessary. Naturally, each case is different and every detail must be taken into account. It is essential not only to act resolutely but also, most importantly, with utmost sensitivity. An impersonal, formal approach must be avoided at all cost and every effort must be made to keep the family together and provide it the support it needs. Success of the efforts for prosperous, secure children\\u2019s lives should not be measured by the number of cases when parents lose custody of their children. That is not the yardstick we should use. On the contrary, the loss of custody is very problematic solution and should be used as a last resort. Sometimes it can be just a dead end. It is an intentional or unintentional destruction of the traditional Russian family, and a strong and happy family cannot be replaced by any law or government oversight agency. That much is certain. What is far more important is to remove the causes of social ills. Of course, this requires long-term systemic efforts that are far more demanding. We must pay constant attention to families, especially those that find themselves in difficult situations; we must work with parents who refuse to bring up their children, provide timely psychological and other assistance to pregnant women who have doubts about their ability to raise the child alone. We have a well-developed legal system and normative base, both our own and international, which we have joined. Russia is party to a number of international legal instruments. We must use this to our advantage and increase these instruments\\u2019 effectiveness. However, I would like to touch on another very important issue: support for the institution of adoption. We must do everything we can to make sure that orphans are adopted by families in their own country, in Russia. You are all aware of the executive order signed at the end of December 2012. The Government was issued instructions to simplify adoption, guardianship and foster care procedures for orphaned and abandoned children, and to take measures to provide tax benefits for the adoptive and foster families, increase the lump sum payments families are entitled to when they adopt a child and the benefits paid to disabled children and persons with class I disabilities from childhood. All these measures will add up to tangible support for our citizens who decide to take in a child from an orphanage. Perhaps we will find other effective support measures with your help. Surveys show that there are more and more people like that, including people wishing to adopt including disabled children and children with special needs. I want to stress that Russian families that adopt children should receive support not only from the state but also from the whole society. Here, we look forward to your active contribution and support. The family must be in the centre of public attention and we should see the family as our national heritage. Since occasions like this are rare, I would like to raise another matter. It is not directly related to the family or the draft laws you have met here to discuss, but your agenda will probably expand to include other issues. It has to do with child education and work with children, and one aspect seems to me particularly important in this regard, especially since it is surrounded by the same special, increased attention from society. I am talking about a standard literature curriculum. As you know, the new curriculum has indeed provoked considerable debate. I share the opinion that some new authors have replaced some works of literature that make up the historical heritage of our country. By the way, I think it is good that there are new authors. True, not everyone shares their political views or the subject matter of their writing. Even so, modern Russian literature is part of world literature, and I believe that we should treat it with respect. However, when the school curriculum excludes Kuprin, Leskov and Alexei Tolstoi, Pushkin\\u2019s The Bronze Horseman, Chekhov\\u2019s The Lady with a Dog or The Man in a Case, and poems by Akhmadulina, Vysotsky and Okudzhava, the question immediately arises: why has this happened and what has replaced them? Let me express a view that may be controversial and perhaps many of you will not agree with me, but I think even serious works of literature may sometimes have obscene language or contain scenes that readers may find shocking, but should such books be part of the compulsory curriculum at school \\u2013 that is the question. I agree with those who question this decision. I believe that the authors of the new literature curriculum should pay attention to criticism, especially since many comments are reasonable, as I have said. Therefore, I expect that the relevant agencies will draw certain conclusions. Friends, I am sure that the people who have met here today are true patriots of our country, true patriots of Russia. This is evidenced by your strong feelings and proactive approach to the events taking place in our country. We can only support your desire to contribute to its successful development. We are grateful for and unconditionally support your concern for the family and the increasing role of patriotic values and civic consciousness in the education of our children. You should have no doubt about it. I am confident that this forum, which brought together like-minded people from many Russian regions, will generate new and exciting ideas that will be needed and realised. We are ready for close partnership and collaboration. I wish you fruitful deliberations.

Mr Pavlopoulos     Pavlopoulos ProkopisPresident of Greece  arrived in Moscow to take part in the forum Russia and the World: A Look into the Future.  * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to meet you in person. You have a busy programme in Moscow. Today, your visit gives us this excellent opportunity to declare the opening of the Year of Russia in Greece and the Year of Greece in Russia. These programmes will see more than 30 different events take place, nearly 40 in fact, 37 events in all. There will be Greek exhibitions at the Hermitage, at the Historical Museum in Moscow, Russian companies will take part in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, and we will organise a round table as part of the 20th St Petersburg International Economic Forum.  Mr President, it is a great pleasure to welcome to Moscow the head of state of Greece, a friendly country with which we share unique historical ties. Welcome!  President of Greece Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for your hospitality and for this reception. I thank you too for the fact that our meeting effectively opens the Year of Greece in Russia and the Year of Russia in Greece. The planned events can and will build closer ties between our close and friendly peoples.  I think that this year will bring us the pleasure of having the opportunity to receive you in Athens. It is your turn to come to Athens now. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Prokopis Pavlopoulos: Mr President, on behalf of the Greek people, the Greek government, and all democratic forces in Greece, I want to say that we value most highly Russia\\u2019s contribution to resolving the world\\u2019s current problems and confronting challenges that are not so much economic as humanitarian in nature.  I believe that no matter what the differences between Russia and the European Union, they can be resolved through dialogue. I think that no matter what these differences may be, they are of little significance compared to the challenges we face at the global level: the need to end the war in the Middle East, in Syria, restore peace, protect people, fight terrorism, which threatens the entire international community, and defeat ISIS.  <\\u2026>\",\n          \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party\\u2019s plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party\\u2019s multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party\\u2019s concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people\\u2019s programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people\\u2019s incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress\\u2019 previous stages.  I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments.  Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people\\u2019s programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people\\u2019s current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them.  I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party\\u2019s local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people\\u2019s safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia\\u2019s sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children.  I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle.  We stand together for Russia.\",\n          \"The President\\u2019s participation in the Congress was not planned, but, as Vladimir Putin said addressing the forum participants, he found it necessary to clarify the national leadership\\u2019s position on these important issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, This is an unusual event, an unusual forum: the Russian Congress of Parents. All of us are parents, at least the majority of Russians are. I understand that today we have a meeting of the core group of parents. Your agenda includes a number of issues that have great importance to our society. I just came in and was told that Mr Kurginyan spoke before me and his speech was very emotional. This is understandable because these issues are very acute and they concern everyone. I thought it was my duty to meet with you and explain my own position on these issues, the position of the country\\u2019s leadership. Especially since I have received a petition, which was addressed to me personally and signed by 141,000 people. I am sure that there would have been even more signatories if everyone interested in this issue had the opportunity to sign the petition. People are truly concerned about and opposed to some mechanisms that are part of the juvenile justice system. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the draft laws proposing direct or indirect regulation of relations between parents and children, as well as special legal mechanisms regarding work with minors. I think everybody realises that it would be wrong to leave absolutely everything as it is. We must move forward, utilise modern techniques that are used in other countries but this should be done very carefully. I would like to say a few words about this issue. This concerns two laws. The first was submitted by the President in March 2012, and the second by the Government on September 25, 2012. As I understand it, those are the laws in question. I would like to make a few points in this regard. First. Public opinion will certainly be heard and taken into account. In these matters, in adopting such laws, there is no room for secrecy or forcing unwanted legislation on society. I would go even further: this applies to all government decisions, or at least that is how it should be. Second, I agree that a number of the draft laws\\u2019 provisions on foster care and control over orphans\\u2019 rights, may be ambiguous and contain explicit social risks. Most importantly, they do not take Russian family traditions fully into account. Russia is a very big country with great ethnic and cultural diversity. There are some regions, for example, the Northern Caucasus (I see representatives of the Northern Caucasus here), where child homelessness and abandonment are historically unknown. Russians and almost all the peoples of Russia have centuries-old traditions of a big family, which unites several generations. Care for the elderly and the children always had special importance. We must revive these traditions, while at the same time making every effort to avoid blindly copying other cultures\\u2019 experience. This is because the management models of social phenomena are controversial in these spheres and in those countries where the rules of juvenile justice are most widely applied. There are some advantages and great many disadvantages. Incidentally, the general public is aware of these disadvantages as experienced by Russian families living abroad. There are many examples where normal, loving and hard-working parents lose custody of their children. Some cases of interference in family life are just absurd and make a mockery of justice. An ill-considered introduction of such mechanisms can lead to the violation of family sovereignty, cause distrust and discord between parents and children, and even outright corruption, when some unscrupulous officials take advantage of such situations. Certainly, we must and will listen to your opinions. I want to assure you of that. Draft laws must be subjected to the most thorough public debate and can only be adopted \\u2013 if they are adopted at all \\u2013 in the event that consensus can be reached on their main provisions. Only then will a draft law\\u2019s sound provisions designed to support families and children gain strong public support. Family law is a very sensitive area. The laws regulating the relationship between parents and children should contain only the most unambiguous and clear language, eliminating bureaucratic abuses and multiple interpretations. The legal drafting methodology must be perfected until it is as good as it can be. In particular, there must be a strict and exhaustive list of signs of extreme distress within a family, when the authorities can and must intervene and provide targeted assistance. Sometimes the situation calls for urgent action on the part of the state, especially when the rights and even the life of a child are at stake. I am sure you will agree with me that intervention in such cases is necessary. Naturally, each case is different and every detail must be taken into account. It is essential not only to act resolutely but also, most importantly, with utmost sensitivity. An impersonal, formal approach must be avoided at all cost and every effort must be made to keep the family together and provide it the support it needs. Success of the efforts for prosperous, secure children\\u2019s lives should not be measured by the number of cases when parents lose custody of their children. That is not the yardstick we should use. On the contrary, the loss of custody is very problematic solution and should be used as a last resort. Sometimes it can be just a dead end. It is an intentional or unintentional destruction of the traditional Russian family, and a strong and happy family cannot be replaced by any law or government oversight agency. That much is certain. What is far more important is to remove the causes of social ills. Of course, this requires long-term systemic efforts that are far more demanding. We must pay constant attention to families, especially those that find themselves in difficult situations; we must work with parents who refuse to bring up their children, provide timely psychological and other assistance to pregnant women who have doubts about their ability to raise the child alone. We have a well-developed legal system and normative base, both our own and international, which we have joined. Russia is party to a number of international legal instruments. We must use this to our advantage and increase these instruments\\u2019 effectiveness. However, I would like to touch on another very important issue: support for the institution of adoption. We must do everything we can to make sure that orphans are adopted by families in their own country, in Russia. You are all aware of the executive order signed at the end of December 2012. The Government was issued instructions to simplify adoption, guardianship and foster care procedures for orphaned and abandoned children, and to take measures to provide tax benefits for the adoptive and foster families, increase the lump sum payments families are entitled to when they adopt a child and the benefits paid to disabled children and persons with class I disabilities from childhood. All these measures will add up to tangible support for our citizens who decide to take in a child from an orphanage. Perhaps we will find other effective support measures with your help. Surveys show that there are more and more people like that, including people wishing to adopt including disabled children and children with special needs. I want to stress that Russian families that adopt children should receive support not only from the state but also from the whole society. Here, we look forward to your active contribution and support. The family must be in the centre of public attention and we should see the family as our national heritage. Since occasions like this are rare, I would like to raise another matter. It is not directly related to the family or the draft laws you have met here to discuss, but your agenda will probably expand to include other issues. It has to do with child education and work with children, and one aspect seems to me particularly important in this regard, especially since it is surrounded by the same special, increased attention from society. I am talking about a standard literature curriculum. As you know, the new curriculum has indeed provoked considerable debate. I share the opinion that some new authors have replaced some works of literature that make up the historical heritage of our country. By the way, I think it is good that there are new authors. True, not everyone shares their political views or the subject matter of their writing. Even so, modern Russian literature is part of world literature, and I believe that we should treat it with respect. However, when the school curriculum excludes Kuprin, Leskov and Alexei Tolstoi, Pushkin\\u2019s The Bronze Horseman, Chekhov\\u2019s The Lady with a Dog or The Man in a Case, and poems by Akhmadulina, Vysotsky and Okudzhava, the question immediately arises: why has this happened and what has replaced them? Let me express a view that may be controversial and perhaps many of you will not agree with me, but I think even serious works of literature may sometimes have obscene language or contain scenes that readers may find shocking, but should such books be part of the compulsory curriculum at school \\u2013 that is the question. I agree with those who question this decision. I believe that the authors of the new literature curriculum should pay attention to criticism, especially since many comments are reasonable, as I have said. Therefore, I expect that the relevant agencies will draw certain conclusions. Friends, I am sure that the people who have met here today are true patriots of our country, true patriots of Russia. This is evidenced by your strong feelings and proactive approach to the events taking place in our country. We can only support your desire to contribute to its successful development. We are grateful for and unconditionally support your concern for the family and the increasing role of patriotic values and civic consciousness in the education of our children. You should have no doubt about it. I am confident that this forum, which brought together like-minded people from many Russian regions, will generate new and exciting ideas that will be needed and realised. We are ready for close partnership and collaboration. I wish you fruitful deliberations. Thank you very much for your position.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"place\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 814,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Lisbon\",\n          \"Cyprus\",\n          \"Alushta\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7548,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Meeting on socioeconomic development of Crimea and Sevastopol\",\n          \"Extracts from a Speech to the Second Poland-Russia Economic Forum\",\n          \"Leaders Summit on Climate\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"no_contract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"transcript_unfiltered_str\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9619,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The subjects of discussion covered bilateral relations, including organisation of the Year of Russia in Greece and Year of Greece in Russia in 2016, and current international affairs. Mr Pavlopoulos Pavlopoulos ProkopisPresident of Greece arrived in Moscow to take part in the forum Russia and the World: A Look into the Future. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to meet you in person. You have a busy programme in Moscow. Today, your visit gives us this excellent opportunity to declare the opening of the Year of Russia in Greece and the Year of Greece in Russia. These programmes will see more than 30 different events take place, nearly 40 in fact, 37 events in all. There will be Greek exhibitions at the Hermitage, at the Historical Museum in Moscow, Russian companies will take part in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, and we will organise a round table as part of the 20th St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Mr President, it is a great pleasure to welcome to Moscow the head of state of Greece, a friendly country with which we share unique historical ties. Welcome! President of Greece Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for your hospitality and for this reception. I thank you too for the fact that our meeting effectively opens the Year of Greece in Russia and the Year of Russia in Greece. The planned events can and will build closer ties between our close and friendly peoples. I think that this year will bring us the pleasure of having the opportunity to receive you in Athens. It is your turn to come to Athens now. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Prokopis Pavlopoulos: Mr President, on behalf of the Greek people, the Greek government, and all democratic forces in Greece, I want to say that we value most highly Russia\\u2019s contribution to resolving the world\\u2019s current problems and confronting challenges that are not so much economic as humanitarian in nature. I believe that no matter what the differences between Russia and the European Union, they can be resolved through dialogue. I think that no matter what these differences may be, they are of little significance compared to the challenges we face at the global level: the need to end the war in the Middle East, in Syria, restore peace, protect people, fight terrorism, which threatens the entire international community, and defeat ISIS. <\\u2026>\",\n          \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party\\u2019s plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party\\u2019s multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party\\u2019s concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people\\u2019s programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people\\u2019s incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress\\u2019 previous stages. I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments. Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people\\u2019s programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people\\u2019s current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them. I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party\\u2019s local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people\\u2019s safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia\\u2019s sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children. I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle. We stand together for Russia.\",\n          \"The President\\u2019s participation in the Congress was not planned, but, as Vladimir Putin said addressing the forum participants, he found it necessary to clarify the national leadership\\u2019s position on these important issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, This is an unusual event, an unusual forum: the Russian Congress of Parents.

These programmes will see more than 30 different events take place, nearly 40 in fact, 37 events in all. There will be Greek exhibitions at the Hermitage, at the Historical Museum in Moscow, Russian companies will take part in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, and we will organise a round table as part of the 20th St Petersburg International Economic Forum.  Mr President, it is a great pleasure to welcome to Moscow the head of state of Greece, a friendly country with which we share unique historical ties. Welcome!  President of Greece Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for your hospitality and for this reception. I thank you too for the fact that our meeting effectively opens the Year of Greece in Russia and the Year of Russia in Greece. The planned events can and will build closer ties between our close and friendly peoples.  I think that this year will bring us the pleasure of having the opportunity to receive you in Athens. It is your turn to come to Athens now. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Prokopis Pavlopoulos: Mr President, on behalf of the Greek people, the Greek government, and all democratic forces in Greece, I want to say that we value most highly Russia\\u2019s contribution to resolving the world\\u2019s current problems and confronting challenges that are not so much economic as humanitarian in nature.  I believe that no matter what the differences between Russia and the European Union, they can be resolved through dialogue. I think that no matter what these differences may be, they are of little significance compared to the challenges we face at the global level: the need to end the war in the Middle East, in Syria, restore peace, protect people, fight terrorism, which threatens the entire international community, and defeat ISIS.  <\\u2026>\",\n          \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party\\u2019s plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party\\u2019s multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party\\u2019s concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people\\u2019s programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people\\u2019s incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress\\u2019 previous stages.  I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments.  Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people\\u2019s programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people\\u2019s current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them.  I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party\\u2019s local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people\\u2019s safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia\\u2019s sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children.  I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle.  We stand together for Russia.\",\n          \"The President\\u2019s participation in the Congress was not planned, but, as Vladimir Putin said addressing the forum participants, he found it necessary to clarify the national leadership\\u2019s position on these important issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, This is an unusual event, an unusual forum: the Russian Congress of Parents. All of us are parents, at least the majority of Russians are. I understand that today we have a meeting of the core group of parents. Your agenda includes a number of issues that have great importance to our society. I just came in and was told that Mr Kurginyan spoke before me and his speech was very emotional. This is understandable because these issues are very acute and they concern everyone. I thought it was my duty to meet with you and explain my own position on these issues, the position of the country\\u2019s leadership. Especially since I have received a petition, which was addressed to me personally and signed by 141,000 people. I am sure that there would have been even more signatories if everyone interested in this issue had the opportunity to sign the petition. People are truly concerned about and opposed to some mechanisms that are part of the juvenile justice system. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the draft laws proposing direct or indirect regulation of relations between parents and children, as well as special legal mechanisms regarding work with minors. I think everybody realises that it would be wrong to leave absolutely everything as it is. We must move forward, utilise modern techniques that are used in other countries but this should be done very carefully. I would like to say a few words about this issue. This concerns two laws. The first was submitted by the President in March 2012, and the second by the Government on September 25, 2012. As I understand it, those are the laws in question. I would like to make a few points in this regard. First. Public opinion will certainly be heard and taken into account. In these matters, in adopting such laws, there is no room for secrecy or forcing unwanted legislation on society. I would go even further: this applies to all government decisions, or at least that is how it should be. Second, I agree that a number of the draft laws\\u2019 provisions on foster care and control over orphans\\u2019 rights, may be ambiguous and contain explicit social risks. Most importantly, they do not take Russian family traditions fully into account. Russia is a very big country with great ethnic and cultural diversity. There are some regions, for example, the Northern Caucasus (I see representatives of the Northern Caucasus here), where child homelessness and abandonment are historically unknown. Russians and almost all the peoples of Russia have centuries-old traditions of a big family, which unites several generations. Care for the elderly and the children always had special importance. We must revive these traditions, while at the same time making every effort to avoid blindly copying other cultures\\u2019 experience. This is because the management models of social phenomena are controversial in these spheres and in those countries where the rules of juvenile justice are most widely applied. There are some advantages and great many disadvantages. Incidentally, the general public is aware of these disadvantages as experienced by Russian families living abroad. There are many examples where normal, loving and hard-working parents lose custody of their children. Some cases of interference in family life are just absurd and make a mockery of justice. An ill-considered introduction of such mechanisms can lead to the violation of family sovereignty, cause distrust and discord between parents and children, and even outright corruption, when some unscrupulous officials take advantage of such situations. Certainly, we must and will listen to your opinions. I want to assure you of that. Draft laws must be subjected to the most thorough public debate and can only be adopted \\u2013 if they are adopted at all \\u2013 in the event that consensus can be reached on their main provisions. Only then will a draft law\\u2019s sound provisions designed to support families and children gain strong public support. Family law is a very sensitive area. The laws regulating the relationship between parents and children should contain only the most unambiguous and clear language, eliminating bureaucratic abuses and multiple interpretations. The legal drafting methodology must be perfected until it is as good as it can be. In particular, there must be a strict and exhaustive list of signs of extreme distress within a family, when the authorities can and must intervene and provide targeted assistance. Sometimes the situation calls for urgent action on the part of the state, especially when the rights and even the life of a child are at stake. I am sure you will agree with me that intervention in such cases is necessary. Naturally, each case is different and every detail must be taken into account. It is essential not only to act resolutely but also, most importantly, with utmost sensitivity. An impersonal, formal approach must be avoided at all cost and every effort must be made to keep the family together and provide it the support it needs. Success of the efforts for prosperous, secure children\\u2019s lives should not be measured by the number of cases when parents lose custody of their children. That is not the yardstick we should use. On the contrary, the loss of custody is very problematic solution and should be used as a last resort. Sometimes it can be just a dead end. It is an intentional or unintentional destruction of the traditional Russian family, and a strong and happy family cannot be replaced by any law or government oversight agency. That much is certain. What is far more important is to remove the causes of social ills. Of course, this requires long-term systemic efforts that are far more demanding. We must pay constant attention to families, especially those that find themselves in difficult situations; we must work with parents who refuse to bring up their children, provide timely psychological and other assistance to pregnant women who have doubts about their ability to raise the child alone. We have a well-developed legal system and normative base, both our own and international, which we have joined. Russia is party to a number of international legal instruments. We must use this to our advantage and increase these instruments\\u2019 effectiveness. However, I would like to touch on another very important issue: support for the institution of adoption. We must do everything we can to make sure that orphans are adopted by families in their own country, in Russia. You are all aware of the executive order signed at the end of December 2012. The Government was issued instructions to simplify adoption, guardianship and foster care procedures for orphaned and abandoned children, and to take measures to provide tax benefits for the adoptive and foster families, increase the lump sum payments families are entitled to when they adopt a child and the benefits paid to disabled children and persons with class I disabilities from childhood. All these measures will add up to tangible support for our citizens who decide to take in a child from an orphanage. Perhaps we will find other effective support measures with your help. Surveys show that there are more and more people like that, including people wishing to adopt including disabled children and children with special needs. I want to stress that Russian families that adopt children should receive support not only from the state but also from the whole society. Here, we look forward to your active contribution and support. The family must be in the centre of public attention and we should see the family as our national heritage. Since occasions like this are rare, I would like to raise another matter. It is not directly related to the family or the draft laws you have met here to discuss, but your agenda will probably expand to include other issues. It has to do with child education and work with children, and one aspect seems to me particularly important in this regard, especially since it is surrounded by the same special, increased attention from society. I am talking about a standard literature curriculum. As you know, the new curriculum has indeed provoked considerable debate. I share the opinion that some new authors have replaced some works of literature that make up the historical heritage of our country. By the way, I think it is good that there are new authors. True, not everyone shares their political views or the subject matter of their writing. Even so, modern Russian literature is part of world literature, and I believe that we should treat it with respect. However, when the school curriculum excludes Kuprin, Leskov and Alexei Tolstoi, Pushkin\\u2019s The Bronze Horseman, Chekhov\\u2019s The Lady with a Dog or The Man in a Case, and poems by Akhmadulina, Vysotsky and Okudzhava, the question immediately arises: why has this happened and what has replaced them? Let me express a view that may be controversial and perhaps many of you will not agree with me, but I think even serious works of literature may sometimes have obscene language or contain scenes that readers may find shocking, but should such books be part of the compulsory curriculum at school \\u2013 that is the question. I agree with those who question this decision. I believe that the authors of the new literature curriculum should pay attention to criticism, especially since many comments are reasonable, as I have said. Therefore, I expect that the relevant agencies will draw certain conclusions. Friends, I am sure that the people who have met here today are true patriots of our country, true patriots of Russia. This is evidenced by your strong feelings and proactive approach to the events taking place in our country. We can only support your desire to contribute to its successful development. We are grateful for and unconditionally support your concern for the family and the increasing role of patriotic values and civic consciousness in the education of our children. You should have no doubt about it. I am confident that this forum, which brought together like-minded people from many Russian regions, will generate new and exciting ideas that will be needed and realised. We are ready for close partnership and collaboration. I wish you fruitful deliberations. Thank you very much for your position.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"place\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 814,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Lisbon\",\n          \"Cyprus\",\n          \"Alushta\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7548,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Meeting on socioeconomic development of Crimea and Sevastopol\",\n          \"Extracts from a Speech to the Second Poland-Russia Economic Forum\",\n          \"Leaders Summit on Climate\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"no_contract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"transcript_unfiltered_str\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9619,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The subjects of discussion covered bilateral relations, including organisation of the Year of Russia in Greece and Year of Greece in Russia in 2016, and current international affairs.

An ill-considered introduction of such mechanisms can lead to the violation of family sovereignty, because distrust and discord between parents and children, and even outright corruption, when some unscrupulous officials take advantage of such situations. Certainly, we must and will listen to your opinions. I want to assure you of that. Draft laws must be subjected to the most thorough public debate and can only be adopted \\u2013 if they are adopted at all \\u2013 in the event that consensus can be reached on their main provisions. Only then will a draft law\\u2019s sound provisions designed to support families and children gain strong public support. Family law is a very sensitive area. The laws regulating the relationship between parents and children should contain only the most unambiguous and clear language, eliminating bureaucratic abuses and multiple interpretations. The legal drafting methodology must be perfected until it is as good as it can be. In particular, there must be a strict and exhaustive list of signs of extreme distress within a family, when the authorities can and must intervene and provide targeted assistance. Sometimes the situation calls for urgent action on the part of the state, especially when the rights and even the life of a child are at stake. I am sure you will agree with me that intervention in such cases is necessary. Naturally, each case is different and every detail must be taken into account. It is essential not only to act resolutely but also, most importantly, with utmost sensitivity. An impersonal, formal approach must be avoided at all cost and every effort must be made to keep the family together and provide it the support it needs. Success of the efforts for prosperous, secure children\\u2019s lives should not be measured by the number of cases when parents lose custody of their children. That is not the yardstick we should use. On the contrary, the loss of custody is very problematic solution and should be used as a last resort. Sometimes it can be just a dead end. It is an intentional or unintentional destruction of the traditional Russian family, and a strong and happy family cannot be replaced by any law or government oversight agency. That much is certain. What is far more important is to remove the causes of social ills. Of course, this requires long-term systemic efforts that are far more demanding. We must pay constant attention to families, especially those that find themselves in difficult situations; we must work with parents who refuse to bring up their children, provide timely psychological and other assistance to pregnant women who have doubts about their ability to raise the child alone. We have a well-developed legal system and normative base, both our own and international, which we have joined. Russia is party to a number of international legal instruments. We must use this to our advantage and increase these instruments\\u2019 effectiveness. However, I would like to touch on another very important issue: support for the institution of adoption. We must do everything we can to make sure that orphans are adopted by families in their own country, in Russia. You are all aware of the executive order signed at the end of December 2012. The Government was issued instructions to simplify adoption, guardianship and foster care procedures for orphaned and abandoned children, and to take measures to provide tax benefits for the adoptive and foster families, increase the lump sum payments families are entitled to when they adopt a child and the benefits paid to disabled children and persons with class I disabilities from childhood. All these measures will add up to tangible support for our citizens who decide to take in a child from an orphanage. Perhaps we will find other effective support measures with your help. Surveys show that there are more and more people like that, including people wishing to adopt including disabled children and children with special needs. I want to stress that Russian families that adopt children should receive support not only from the state but also from the whole society. Here, we look forward to your active contribution and support. The family must be in the centre of public attention and we should see the family as our national heritage. Since occasions like this are rare, I would like to raise another matter. It is not directly related to the family or the draft laws you have met here to discuss, but your agenda will probably expand to include other issues. It has to do with child education and work with children, and one aspect seems to me particularly important in this regard, especially since it is surrounded by the same special, increased attention from society. I am talking about a standard literature curriculum. As you know, the new curriculum has indeed provoked considerable debate. I share the opinion that some new authors have replaced some works of literature that make up the historical heritage of our country. By the way, I think it is good that there are new authors. True, not everyone shares their political views or the subject matter of their writing. Even so, modern Russian literature is part of world literature, and I believe that we should treat it with respect. However, when the school curriculum excludes Kuprin, Leskov and Alexei Tolstoi, Pushkin\\u2019s The Bronze Horseman, Chekhov\\u2019s The Lady with a Dog or The Man in a Case, and poems by Akhmadulina, Vysotsky and Okudzhava, the question immediately arises: why has this happened and what has replaced them? Let me express a view that may be controversial and perhaps many of you will not agree with me, but I think even serious works of literature may sometimes have obscene language or contain scenes that readers may find shocking, but should such books be part of the compulsory curriculum at school \\u2013 that is the question. I agree with those who question this decision. I believe that the authors of the new literature curriculum should pay attention to criticism, especially since many comments are reasonable, as I have said. Therefore, I expect that the relevant agencies will draw certain conclusions. Friends, I am sure that the people who have met here today are true patriots of our country, true patriots of Russia. This is evidenced by your strong feelings and proactive approach to the events taking place in our country. We can only support your desire to contribute to its successful development. We are grateful for and unconditionally support your concern for the family and the increasing role of patriotic values and civic consciousness in the education of our children. You should have no doubt about it. I am confident that this forum, which brought together like-minded people from many Russian regions, will generate new and exciting ideas that will be needed and realised. We are ready for close partnership and collaboration. I wish you fruitful deliberations. Thank you very much for your position.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"langs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"en\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"transcripts_word_tokenized\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"transcripts_sentence_tokenized\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lower\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"transcripts_phrase_tokenized\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"no_punc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Mr Pavlopoulos     Pavlopoulos ProkopisPresident of Greece  arrived in Moscow to take part in the forum Russia and the World: A Look into the Future.  * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to meet you in person. You have a busy programme in Moscow. Today, your visit gives us this excellent opportunity to declare the opening of the Year of Russia in Greece and the Year of Greece in Russia. These programmes will see more than 30 different events take place, nearly 40 in fact, 37 events in all. There will be Greek exhibitions at the Hermitage, at the Historical Museum in Moscow, Russian companies will take part in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, and we will organise a round table as part of the 20th St Petersburg International Economic Forum.  Mr President, it is a great pleasure to welcome to Moscow the head of state of Greece, a friendly country with which we share unique historical ties. Welcome!  President of Greece Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for your hospitality and for this reception. I thank you too for the fact that our meeting effectively opens the Year of Greece in Russia and the Year of Russia in Greece. The planned events can and will build closer ties between our close and friendly peoples.  I think that this year will bring us the pleasure of having the opportunity to receive you in Athens. It is your turn to come to Athens now. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Prokopis Pavlopoulos: Mr President, on behalf of the Greek people, the Greek government, and all democratic forces in Greece, I want to say that we value most highly Russia\\u2019s contribution to resolving the world\\u2019s current problems and confronting challenges that are not so much economic as humanitarian in nature.  I believe that no matter what the differences between Russia and the European Union, they can be resolved through dialogue. I think that no matter what these differences may be, they are of little significance compared to the challenges we face at the global level: the need to end the war in the Middle East, in Syria, restore peace, protect people, fight terrorism, which threatens the entire international community, and defeat ISIS.  <\\u2026>\",\n          \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party\\u2019s plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party\\u2019s multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party\\u2019s concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people\\u2019s programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people\\u2019s incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress\\u2019 previous stages.  I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments.  Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people\\u2019s programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people\\u2019s current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them.  I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party\\u2019s local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people\\u2019s safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia\\u2019s sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children.  I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle.  We stand together for Russia.\",\n          \"The President\\u2019s participation in the Congress was not planned, but, as Vladimir Putin said addressing the forum participants, he found it necessary to clarify the national leadership\\u2019s position on these important issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, This is an unusual event, an unusual forum: the Russian Congress of Parents. All of us are parents, at least the majority of Russians are. I understand that today we have a meeting of the core group of parents. Your agenda includes a number of issues that have great importance to our society. I just came in and was told that Mr Kurginyan spoke before me and his speech was very emotional. This is understandable because these issues are very acute and they concern everyone. I thought it was my duty to meet with you and explain my own position on these issues, the position of the country\\u2019s leadership. Especially since I have received a petition, which was addressed to me personally and signed by 141,000 people. I am sure that there would have been even more signatories if everyone interested in this issue had the opportunity to sign the petition. People are truly concerned about and opposed to some mechanisms that are part of the juvenile justice system. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the draft laws proposing direct or indirect regulation of relations between parents and children, as well as special legal mechanisms regarding work with minors. I think everybody realises that it would be wrong to leave absolutely everything as it is. We must move forward, utilise modern techniques that are used in other countries but this should be done very carefully. I would like to say a few words about this issue. This concerns two laws. The first was submitted by the President in March 2012, and the second by the Government on September 25, 2012. As I understand it, those are the laws in question. I would like to make a few points in this regard. First. Public opinion will certainly be heard and taken into account. In these matters, in adopting such laws, there is no room for secrecy or forcing unwanted legislation on society. I would go even further: this applies to all government decisions, or at least that is how it should be. Second, I agree that a number of the draft laws\\u2019 provisions on foster care and control over orphans\\u2019 rights, may be ambiguous and contain explicit social risks. Most importantly, they do not take Russian family traditions fully into account. Russia is a very big country with great ethnic and cultural diversity. There are some regions, for example, the Northern Caucasus (I see representatives of the Northern Caucasus here), where child homelessness and abandonment are historically unknown. Russians and almost all the peoples of Russia have centuries-old traditions of a big family, which unites several generations. Care for the elderly and the children always had special importance. We must revive these traditions, while at the same time making every effort to avoid blindly copying other cultures\\u2019 experience. This is because the management models of social phenomena are controversial in these spheres and in those countries where the rules of juvenile justice are most widely applied. There are some advantages and great many disadvantages. Incidentally, the general public is aware of these disadvantages as experienced by Russian families living abroad. There are many examples where normal, loving and hard-working parents lose custody of their children. Some cases of interference in family life are just absurd and make a mockery of justice. An ill-considered introduction of such mechanisms can lead to the violation of family sovereignty, cause distrust and discord between parents and children, and even outright corruption, when some unscrupulous officials take advantage of such situations. Certainly, we must and will listen to your opinions. I want to assure you of that. Draft laws must be subjected to the most thorough public debate and can only be adopted \\u2013 if they are adopted at all \\u2013 in the event that consensus can be reached on their main provisions. Only then will a draft law\\u2019s sound provisions designed to support families and children gain strong public support. Family law is a very sensitive area. The laws regulating the relationship between parents and children should contain only the most unambiguous and clear language, eliminating bureaucratic abuses and multiple interpretations. The legal drafting methodology must be perfected until it is as good as it can be. In particular, there must be a strict and exhaustive list of signs of extreme distress within a family, when the authorities can and must intervene and provide targeted assistance. Sometimes the situation calls for urgent action on the part of the state, especially when the rights and even the life of a child are at stake. I am sure you will agree with me that intervention in such cases is necessary. Naturally, each case is different and every detail must be taken into account. It is essential not only to act resolutely but also, most importantly, with utmost sensitivity. An impersonal, formal approach must be avoided at all cost and every effort must be made to keep the family together and provide it the support it needs. Success of the efforts for prosperous, secure children\\u2019s lives should not be measured by the number of cases when parents lose custody of their children. That is not the yardstick we should use. On the contrary, the loss of custody is very problematic solution and should be used as a last resort. Sometimes it can be just a dead end. It is an intentional or unintentional destruction of the traditional Russian family, and a strong and happy family cannot be replaced by any law or government oversight agency. That much is certain. What is far more important is to remove the causes of social ills. Of course, this requires long-term systemic efforts that are far more demanding. We must pay constant attention to families, especially those that find themselves in difficult situations; we must work with parents who refuse to bring up their children, provide timely psychological and other assistance to pregnant women who have doubts about their ability to raise the child alone. We have a well-developed legal system and normative base, both our own and international, which we have joined. Russia is party to a number of international legal instruments. We must use this to our advantage and increase these instruments\\u2019 effectiveness. However, I would like to touch on another very important issue: support for the institution of adoption. We must do everything we can to make sure that orphans are adopted by families in their own country, in Russia. You are all aware of the executive order signed at the end of December 2012. The Government was issued instructions to simplify adoption, guardianship and foster care procedures for orphaned and abandoned children, and to take measures to provide tax benefits for the adoptive and foster families, increase the lump sum payments families are entitled to when they adopt a child and the benefits paid to disabled children and persons with class I disabilities from childhood. All these measures will add up to tangible support for our citizens who decide to take in a child from an orphanage. Perhaps we will find other effective support measures with your help. Surveys show that there are more and more people like that, including people wishing to adopt including disabled children and children with special needs. I want to stress that Russian families that adopt children should receive support not only from the state but also from the whole society. Here, we look forward to your active contribution and support. The family must be in the centre of public attention and we should see the family as our national heritage. Since occasions like this are rare, I would like to raise another matter. It is not directly related to the family or the draft laws you have met here to discuss, but your agenda will probably expand to include other issues. It has to do with child education and work with children, and one aspect seems to me particularly important in this regard, especially since it is surrounded by the same special, increased attention from society. I am talking about a standard literature curriculum. As you know, the new curriculum has indeed provoked considerable debate. I share the opinion that some new authors have replaced some works of literature that make up the historical heritage of our country. By the way, I think it is good that there are new authors. True, not everyone shares their political views or the subject matter of their writing. Even so, modern Russian literature is part of world literature, and I believe that we should treat it with respect. However, when the school curriculum excludes Kuprin, Leskov and Alexei Tolstoi, Pushkin\\u2019s The Bronze Horseman, Chekhov\\u2019s The Lady with a Dog or The Man in a Case, and poems by Akhmadulina, Vysotsky and Okudzhava, the question immediately arises: why has this happened and what has replaced them? Let me express a view that may be controversial and perhaps many of you will not agree with me, but I think even serious works of literature may sometimes have obscene language or contain scenes that readers may find shocking, but should such books be part of the compulsory curriculum at school \\u2013 that is the question. I agree with those who question this decision. I believe that the authors of the new literature curriculum should pay attention to criticism, especially since many comments are reasonable, as I have said. Therefore, I expect that the relevant agencies will draw certain conclusions. Friends, I am sure that the people who have met here today are true patriots of our country, true patriots of Russia. This is evidenced by your strong feelings and proactive approach to the events taking place in our country. We can only support your desire to contribute to its successful development. We are grateful for and unconditionally support your concern for the family and the increasing role of patriotic values and civic consciousness in the education of our children. You should have no doubt about it.

Mr Pavlopoulos Pavlopoulos ProkopisPresident of Greece arrived in Moscow to take part in the forum Russia and the World: A Look into the Future. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I am very pleased to meet you in person. You have a busy programme in Moscow. Today, your visit gives us this excellent opportunity to declare the opening of the Year of Russia in Greece and the Year of Greece in Russia. These programmes will see more than 30 different events take place, nearly 40 in fact, 37 events in all. There will be Greek exhibitions at the Hermitage, at the Historical Museum in Moscow, Russian companies will take part in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, and we will organise a round table as part of the 20th St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Mr President, it is a great pleasure to welcome to Moscow the head of state of Greece, a friendly country with which we share unique historical ties. Welcome! President of Greece Prokopis Pavlopoulos (retranslated): Mr President, thank you for your hospitality and for this reception. I thank you too for the fact that our meeting effectively opens the Year of Greece in Russia and the Year of Russia in Greece. The planned events can and will build closer ties between our close and friendly peoples. I think that this year will bring us the pleasure of having the opportunity to receive you in Athens. It is your turn to come to Athens now. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Prokopis Pavlopoulos: Mr President, on behalf of the Greek people, the Greek government, and all democratic forces in Greece, I want to say that we value most highly Russia\\u2019s contribution to resolving the world\\u2019s current problems and confronting challenges that are not so much economic as humanitarian in nature. I believe that no matter what the differences between Russia and the European Union, they can be resolved through dialogue. I think that no matter what these differences may be, they are of little significance compared to the challenges we face at the global level: the need to end the war in the Middle East, in Syria, restore peace, protect people, fight terrorism, which threatens the entire international community, and defeat ISIS. <\\u2026>\",\n          \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, Greetings to all participants in the final, third stage of the United Russia congress. You are to discuss the party\\u2019s plans and to carry out rotation in its governing and central bodies. And of course, it is important to analyse the results of the autumn elections here, at the congress. I believe that United Russia has performed well in the rather difficult, even extraordinary conditions of the election campaign, has withstood tough and open competition, won confidently, with a good advantage, and once again proved that it is a true leader, a party of popular representation with a parliamentary majority. Once again, congratulations on your resounding victory. This result is extremely significant for our entire country, for its stable and effective development. Your success was not determined by loud and attractive slogans, which mainly involve nothing but empty and impossible promises. You had a different campaign style, a different approach, a different attitude towards voters. The party offered the citizens of Russia a constructive, fruitful and unifying agenda and presented a programme that it began to form long before the elections, during the course of meetings and conversations with people and through discussing topical, acute, pressing issues with them. The programme is rightfully called popular, because it is based on the proposals and initiatives of the citizens of our huge country, of all its regions. And what is important, each of its points is well-weighed and calculated from the point of view of implementation within defined, specific deadlines. I believe that voters positively assessed the updated composition of United Russia. Volunteers, civic activists, and youth leaders became its candidates for election at various levels. Almost half of the composition of your faction in the State Duma of the eighth convocation has changed. United Russia was one of the first major socio-political forces that supported the We Are Together volunteer movement and took an active part in it. Many members and supporters of the party became volunteers in the very first days of the pandemic: they helped doctors and nurses in hospitals and outpatient clinics, delivered food and medicines and did everything in their power to make people feel their care and attention in those difficult times. It is crucially important that you continue this work. Of course, there is no other way because our policy and our common goals and plans are focused on the people, their needs, wellbeing and quality of life. This is an unconditional priority both for United Russia as the leading political force and for those present here today, as well as for hundreds of thousands of our colleagues and associates in all regions of the country. I want to emphasise that the ultimate point of being a member of United Russia and working for it is to serve the people and respect the people. It is protecting, defending and implementing the interests of our citizens. I am glad that the party\\u2019s multifaceted activity is aimed at dealing with such issues all the time, not only during election campaigns. I consider it a good thing that you are going to report to people annually, tell them about the party\\u2019s concrete activities and what it has achieved. We need to speak openly about sensitive issues and about those that have not been dealt with, and to suggest solutions. I want to note that after the elections, the United Russia party immediately began implementing its goals. This shows responsibility, and the maturity of the political force. Because every word that we give people must become a real deed and the achieved result must change life for the better. The people\\u2019s programme is already being implemented. Its priorities are reflected in the federal budget for the next three years. Our parliamentary faction not only supported this draft law but also made some important amendments of a social nature and helped ensure that some important decisions were made, such as increasing the minimum monthly wage and subsistence rate. I would like to thank you for your support and for quickly implementing these measures that aim to raise people\\u2019s incomes, and I would also like to thank you for promoting other initiatives that we agreed on during the election campaign, including in June and August, at the Congress\\u2019 previous stages. I would like to recall that, at the time, this concerned additional payments to senior citizens, the indexation of pensions and pay grades of service personnel and law enforcement officers, and new ambitious programmes to provide employment for young people, to relocate tenants of dilapidated housing, to develop a medical rehabilitation system, and to build and overhaul schools. In the future, I am asking you to toughen public control over all these matters and other aspects seen as significant by the people. For this purpose, you should use the potential of party commissions, now headed by the leaders of the United Russia ticket. They successfully guided the party to victory, and I know that they are now ready to make their contribution to implementing various commitments. Regarding the organisation of work in general, I suggest sticking to the following principle: you should set new and more ambitious tasks after accomplishing any particular task. Consequently, the United Russia people\\u2019s programme will be implemented in terms of various projects, and it will also develop as a living document, it will be renewed dynamically and in a high-quality manner, so as to meet the demands of the times and people\\u2019s current needs and expectations. They reach out to you, those who represent them in the corridors of power, on the most pressing matters of concern to them. They hope that the most influential political forces will respond and promptly assist them. I would like to note that we have all the resources for supporting people in addressing the matters they raise. And the party\\u2019s local divisions, the so-called grass-roots organisations, should play a key role here. First of all, it is necessary to consolidate detailed and result-oriented public dialogue at this level and, on the whole, to value and expand feedback that helps the party itself to grow and become stronger in terms of ideology and human resources, to rely on those who have won a reputation for themselves in significant public activities, science, business operations and creative spheres. By relying on those who are talented, successful and caring, by taking their opinions into account and engaging them in joint projects, and by helping them to make a political career, the party ensures broad public representation, which is a strategically important mission. I am confident that United Russia can accomplish it through reliance on its prestige and considerable political experience. The party was established 20 years ago. I remember its constituent congress very well. It took place on December 1, 2001. I would like to say that the ability to take responsibility for the country and to work for the people has been its strong side from day one. The party more than once proved with its deeds that it satisfies these requirements. The essence of its activities was to make a decisive contribution to overcoming the systemic and sometimes deadly risks, which threatened not only people\\u2019s safety but the very existence of our homeland at the turn of the 2000s. During the past 20 years, the party firmly and consistently held patriotic positions, which was clearly manifested during the adoption of fundamental, history-making and pivotal decisions on strengthening Russia\\u2019s sovereignty, protecting its national interests, improving its political system, boosting the economy, developing modern approaches to social problems, and supporting families with children. I would like to emphasise the consolidating role of United Russia as a parliamentary party. Your efforts at the federal and regional levels are helping to rally patriotically-minded and responsible forces towards achieving our common goals and priorities. This is extremely important for adopting high-quality laws in the interests of our society and citizens. I always count on you, on the United Russia party as a powerful and reliable political force, and on your professionalism and energy in addressing the large-scale tasks we have planned for the coming years and for the longer term. I would like to thank you for your invariable support, to congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the party, and to wish you success in your striving to move ahead at full throttle. We stand together for Russia.\",\n          \"The President\\u2019s participation in the Congress was not planned, but, as Vladimir Putin said addressing the forum participants, he found it necessary to clarify the national leadership\\u2019s position on these important issues. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, This is an unusual event, an unusual forum: the Russian Congress of Parents. All of us are parents, at least the majority of Russians are. I understand that today we have a meeting of the core group of parents. Your agenda includes a number of issues that have great importance to our society. I just came in and was told that Mr Kurginyan spoke before me and his speech was very emotional. This is understandable because these issues are very acute and they concern everyone. I thought it was my duty to meet with you and explain my own position on these issues, the position of the country\\u2019s leadership. Especially since I have received a petition, which was addressed to me personally and signed by 141,000 people. I am sure that there would have been even more signatories if everyone interested in this issue had the opportunity to sign the petition. People are truly concerned about and opposed to some mechanisms that are part of the juvenile justice system. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the draft laws proposing direct or indirect regulation of relations between parents and children, as well as special legal mechanisms regarding work with minors. I think everybody realises that it would be wrong to leave absolutely everything as it is. We must move forward, utilise modern techniques that are used in other countries but this should be done very carefully. I would like to say a few words about this issue. This concerns two laws. The first was submitted by the President in March 2012, and the second by the Government on September 25, 2012. As I understand it, those are the laws in question. I would like to make a few points in this regard. First. Public opinion will certainly be heard and taken into account. In these matters, in adopting such laws, there is no room for secrecy or forcing unwanted legislation on society. I would go even further: this applies to all government decisions, or at least that is how it should be. Second, I agree that a number of the draft laws\\u2019 provisions on foster care and control over orphans\\u2019 rights, may be ambiguous and contain explicit social risks. Most importantly, they do not take Russian family traditions fully into account. Russia is a very big country with great ethnic and cultural diversity. There are some regions, for example, the Northern Caucasus (I see representatives of the Northern Caucasus here), where child homelessness and abandonment are historically unknown. Russians and almost all the peoples of Russia have centuries-old traditions of a big family, which unites several generations. Care for the elderly and the children always had special importance. We must revive these traditions, while at the same time making every effort to avoid blindly copying other cultures\\u2019 experience. This is because the management models of social phenomena are controversial in these spheres and in those countries where the rules of juvenile justice are most widely applied. There are some advantages and great many disadvantages. Incidentally, the general public is aware of these disadvantages as experienced by Russian families living abroad. There are many examples where normal, loving and hard-working parents lose custody of their children. Some cases of interference in family life are just absurd and make a mockery of justice. An ill-considered introduction of such mechanisms can lead to the violation of family sovereignty, because distrust and discord between parents and children, and even outright corruption, when some unscrupulous officials take advantage of such situations. Certainly, we must and will listen to your opinions. I want to assure you of that. Draft laws must be subjected to the most thorough public debate and can only be adopted \\u2013 if they are adopted at all \\u2013 in the event that consensus can be reached on their main provisions. Only then will a draft law\\u2019s sound provisions designed to support families and children gain strong public support. Family law is a very sensitive area. The laws regulating the relationship between parents and children should contain only the most unambiguous and clear language, eliminating bureaucratic abuses and multiple interpretations. The legal drafting methodology must be perfected until it is as good as it can be. In particular, there must be a strict and exhaustive list of signs of extreme distress within a family, when the authorities can and must intervene and provide targeted assistance. Sometimes the situation calls for urgent action on the part of the state, especially when the rights and even the life of a child are at stake. I am sure you will agree with me that intervention in such cases is necessary. Naturally, each case is different and every detail must be taken into account. It is essential not only to act resolutely but also, most importantly, with utmost sensitivity. An impersonal, formal approach must be avoided at all cost and every effort must be made to keep the family together and provide it the support it needs. Success of the efforts for prosperous, secure children\\u2019s lives should not be measured by the number of cases when parents lose custody of their children. That is not the yardstick we should use. On the contrary, the loss of custody is very problematic solution and should be used as a last resort. Sometimes it can be just a dead end. It is an intentional or unintentional destruction of the traditional Russian family, and a strong and happy family cannot be replaced by any law or government oversight agency. That much is certain. What is far more important is to remove the causes of social ills. Of course, this requires long-term systemic efforts that are far more demanding. We must pay constant attention to families, especially those that find themselves in difficult situations; we must work with parents who refuse to bring up their children, provide timely psychological and other assistance to pregnant women who have doubts about their ability to raise the child alone. We have a well-developed legal system and normative base, both our own and international, which we have joined. Russia is party to a number of international legal instruments. We must use this to our advantage and increase these instruments\\u2019 effectiveness. However, I would like to touch on another very important issue: support for the institution of adoption. We must do everything we can to make sure that orphans are adopted by families in their own country, in Russia. You are all aware of the executive order signed at the end of December 2012. The Government was issued instructions to simplify adoption, guardianship and foster care procedures for orphaned and abandoned children, and to take measures to provide tax benefits for the adoptive and foster families, increase the lump sum payments families are entitled to when they adopt a child and the benefits paid to disabled children and persons with class I disabilities from childhood. All these measures will add up to tangible support for our citizens who decide to take in a child from an orphanage. Perhaps we will find other effective support measures with your help. Surveys show that there are more and more people like that, including people wishing to adopt including disabled children and children with special needs. I want to stress that Russian families that adopt children should receive support not only from the state but also from the whole society. Here, we look forward to your active contribution and support. The family must be in the centre of public attention and we should see the family as our national heritage. Since occasions like this are rare, I would like to raise another matter. It is not directly related to the family or the draft laws you have met here to discuss, but your agenda will probably expand to include other issues. It has to do with child education and work with children, and one aspect seems to me particularly important in this regard, especially since it is surrounded by the same special, increased attention from society. I am talking about a standard literature curriculum. As you know, the new curriculum has indeed provoked considerable debate. I share the opinion that some new authors have replaced some works of literature that make up the historical heritage of our country. By the way, I think it is good that there are new authors. True, not everyone shares their political views or the subject matter of their writing. Even so, modern Russian literature is part of world literature, and I believe that we should treat it with respect. However, when the school curriculum excludes Kuprin, Leskov and Alexei Tolstoi, Pushkin\\u2019s The Bronze Horseman, Chekhov\\u2019s The Lady with a Dog or The Man in a Case, and poems by Akhmadulina, Vysotsky and Okudzhava, the question immediately arises: why has this happened and what has replaced them? Let me express a view that may be controversial and perhaps many of you will not agree with me, but I think even serious works of literature may sometimes have obscene language or contain scenes that readers may find shocking, but should such books be part of the compulsory curriculum at school \\u2013 that is the question. I agree with those who question this decision. I believe that the authors of the new literature curriculum should pay attention to criticism, especially since many comments are reasonable, as I have said. Therefore, I expect that the relevant agencies will draw certain conclusions. Friends, I am sure that the people who have met here today are true patriots of our country, true patriots of Russia. This is evidenced by your strong feelings and proactive approach to the events taking place in our country. We can only support your desire to contribute to its successful development. We are grateful for and unconditionally support your concern for the family and the increasing role of patriotic values and civic consciousness in the education of our children. You should have no doubt about it. I am confident that this forum, which brought together like-minded people from many Russian regions, will generate new and exciting ideas that will be needed and realised. We are ready for close partnership and collaboration. I wish you fruitful deliberations. Thank you very much for your position.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"langs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"en\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"transcripts_word_tokenized\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"transcripts_sentence_tokenized\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lower\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"transcripts_phrase_tokenized\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"no_punc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"stopwords_removed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
