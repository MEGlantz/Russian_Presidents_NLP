We held the IX Interregional Cooperation Forum, which focused on Innovation Cooperation, in one of Kazakhstan’s largest industrial centres, the city of Pavlodar. Choosing this city was no accident: neighbouring states account for up to 70 percent of trade turnover in Pavlodar Region. This region generates 40 percent of our nation’s electric power and produces 100 percent of its metallic aluminium; it also has well-developed chemical and agricultural sectors. The expansion of Ekibastuz GRES-2 power station, which is a joint venture with Russia with an investment volume of one billion dollars, and launching the third power generating unit – all this is very important and necessary for our nation. The electricity generated is used both by Russia and by Kazakhstan. I am pleased to note that we are gradually developing trade between our nations: in the last year, turnover grew by 30 percent to constitute more than $23 billion, and in the first half of this year it exceeded $11 billion. More than 20 business agreements were signed within the framework of this forum worth a total of approximately $2 billion. In a separate meeting with President of the Russian Federation Mr Putin, we discussed the upcoming events marking the 20th anniversary of the Treaty between Kazakhstan and Russia on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, and the establishment of diplomatic relations between our nations. During the talks, we addressed cooperation in space exploration, joint use of the Baikonur space launch facility, rational use of water resources, and protecting trans-border rivers. We also looked into problems of industrial and innovative interregional development and efficient cooperation in the fuel and energy sector. We are consistently strengthening Russia and Kazakhstan’s cooperation within the framework of the Common Economic Space and the Customs Union. Today, we have eliminated many customs barriers that existed between our nations at the boarders, and this is helping us actively develop joint production projects. I feel that this union will be quite attractive to many nations around the world in the future. I will take this opportunity to congratulate the Russian side on its accession to the World Trade Organisation. We are striving to do the same, and in accordance with our agreements, we will be joining it with Russia’s support. Several agreements were signed in our presence today aimed at deepening bilateral relations in various sectors of our economies. In conclusion, I want to once again thank you, Mr President, as well as our Russian friends, for participating in this Forum. I am sure that the agreements reached here will help to develop and further strengthen partner relations between our nations and serve for the good of our peoples and our nations. The next, tenth Forum will be held in Russia. We agreed with Russia’s suggestion to hold it in Yekaterinburg. Thank you. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: This year is a special year in Russian-Kazakhstani relations: we are marking the 20th anniversary of the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, as well as the 20th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations. By historic measurements, this is a fairly short period, but in this time, we have been able to achieve a great deal. We have laid a strong foundation for our relations, which have been progressing to this day – and, I hope, will continue to do so in the future – in the spirit of strategic partnership and cooperation. We have created and are constantly improving our extensive contractual legal framework, and we are constantly maintaining intensive business and political contacts at all levels. As you know, the theme of the IX Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum is Innovative Cooperation. This is a particularly important area in our joint work. Innovative development and diversification of our economy are strategic directions for the Russian economy (as I’m sure members of the press are aware), but they are no less important for Kazakhstan as well. And if we join forces to resolve certain problems, we can do it more efficiently. That is precisely the goal of creating the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space. We are really increasing our common competitiveness. I have already told Mr Nazarbayev this, and I can say it again: at the recent APEC summit in Vladivostok, many of our partners from this highly promising and successfully-developing region of the world gave a lot of attention to our Customs Union and Common Economic Space. And in my bilateral meetings, I was almost always asked about how our work is organised. Many of our partners in the Asia-Pacific region expressed a clear desire to create direct contacts and establish special relations with the Common Economic Space and the Customs Union. This is promising work, especially since we plan to continue improving our integration cooperation, up to the point of creating a Eurasian Economic Union. Today, Mr Nazarbayev and I discussed cooperation in the monetary and financial sector. The President of Kazakhstan raised these issues, meaning that for our national currencies’ fluctuations we need to develop a mechanism that will help us maintain our competitiveness, that will not allow any blunders or losses for our economies and for specific companies engaged in economic activity. Incidentally, I can tell you that a deal was made by one of Russia’s largest banks, Sberbank, to sell a 7.58-percent stake for $5,208 billion. This is one of the most profitable deals of the last decade in this area, following Apple. For every $100 invested in Sberbank ten years ago, its major shareholder – the Central Bank of the Russian Federation – got $3,700 today. That’s $3,700 dollars for every $100 invested ten years ago. This is a very good profitability level and it speaks to the potential of Russia’s credit financial institutions, the appeal of those credit financial institutions and the opportunity to broaden our joint work in this direction. Participants in the Forum came up with a whole range of very interesting and promising ideas, including in the SME sector. And naturally, financial support in this area is very much needed. During the Forum, we signed a whole package of bilateral agreements. Mr Nazarbayev mentioned this, and you saw it all for yourselves. The Forum’s outcomes deserve the highest assessment. What’s most important is that they are aimed at providing for the basic needs and improving the quality of life for our people, the citizens of our nations, who reside in near-border regions on both sides. Mr Nazarbayev and I had our bilateral meeting, which the President of Kazakhstan spoke about. We had the chance to discuss the full range of bilateral relations, the situation in the region and in the world overall. We spoke about the most pressing problems that certain nations are facing today. Many of these things directly affect the interests of both Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. In conclusion, I would also like to thank the residents of Pavlodar and, of course, the Kazakhstani leadership and President Nazarbayev for making it possible for us to meet today under such good conditions and have the opportunity to discuss the problems that are of interest to us and whose resolution will determine the quality of life for our citizens.

By historic measurements, this is a fairly short period, but in this time, we have been able to achieve a great deal. We have laid a strong foundation for our relations, which have been progressing to this day – and, I hope, will continue to do so in the future – in the spirit of strategic partnership and cooperation. We have created and are constantly improving our extensive contractual legal framework, and we are constantly maintaining intensive business and political contacts at all levels. As you know, the theme of the IX Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum is Innovative Cooperation. This is a particularly important area in our joint work. Innovative development and diversification of our economy are strategic directions for the Russian economy (as I’m sure members of the press are aware), but they are no less important for Kazakhstan as well.

Another agreement defines the status and operation conditions of the Russian military base in Kyrgyzstan. In addition, the parties signed a protocol on defence cooperation in the period preceding the entry into force of the agreement on the Russian military base.

The Russian President arrived in Kyrgyzstan last night from Kazakhstan, where he took part in the IX Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum. * * * Press statements and answers to journalists' questions following Russian-Kyrgyzstani talks President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev: Mr President, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Belyaninov [head of the Federal Customs Service of Russia] on receiving a state decoration of Kyrgyzstan. For those of you who do not know about it, I want to say that if it were not for Mr Belyaninov, we may not have been able to erect a monument to Manas on Ala-Too Square in time for the Independence Day festivities last year. It is also unlikely that we would have built a monument to Manas in Moscow, as we had not been able to do it for the past 10 years. It is a merit of Mr Belyaninov, who is a great friend of Kyrgyzstan, both in his official function and unofficially, a sort of our man in Moscow. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Yes, your very own. Almazbek Atambayev: The Order of Daanaker is named after a person who unites people and brings integrity and friendship. We had different problems in the past but Mr Belyaninov always did everything in his power to revitalise the relations between Kyrgyzstan and Russia. Mr Belyaninov, the first award I conferred was for you. I think you truly deserve it and I congratulate you once again. Mr President, I want to thank you again for accepting our invitation to make an official visit. We have finally signed many agreements that have been in the making for years, or even decades in some cases. I want to note that the breakthrough was made during the visit of Mr Shuvalov [First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia]. I think that was when we made a real step forward. Today we have consolidated this progress and all the agreements have been signed. I want to make it clear that Russia is our main strategic partner: we have a shared history and a common destiny with Russia. I am certain that we cannot have a future that doesn’t include Russia. Our future lies in a union and a strategic partnership with the great Russia. Once again I want to thank all the experts present, all of those who worked on the documents, and President Putin, of course, for his political will. I think many people did not believe these documents would ever be signed and many still view Kyrgyzstan with suspicion. Thank you, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Mr President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, We are very satisfied with the work that has been done in recent months and the signing of key documents. First of all, they concern the financial settlements from the previous years between the Russian Federation and Kyrgyzstan. This creates a good basis for the expansion of trade and economic relations, and they are developing very positively. Last year, we posted an increase of 5%, with growth exceeding 30% in the first six months of 2012. I have already talked about this at our expanded meeting. Russia remains Kyrgyzstan’s main trade partner. New fundamental conditions for our cooperation have been created with the signing of the documents, not only those focused on financial relations, but also energy cooperation agreements. As you know, we have signed the agreements for the construction of Kambarata-1 HPP and the Upper Naryn cascade HPP. These are major, serious multi-billion projects, and I want to stress that they will contribute to Kyrgyzstan’s economic growth, create jobs and increase prosperity. We have also reached agreement on the operation of a joint military base in Kyrgyzstan. I think many people here in Kyrgyzstan remember how it was established. It was set up when terrorist gangs entered the territory of Kyrgyzstan. The Government of Kyrgyzstan turned to Russia to establish a military outpost here that would serve as a barrier against drug trafficking, drugs and extremism trying to enter Kyrgyzstan. We established the base and now we have agreed with the leadership of Kyrgyzstan to continue its operation. Certainly, this is a very important element that strengthens the trust between our two countries. I am sure many people know about our humanitarian cooperation. Kyrgyzstan and Russia worked and lived as part of a single state for many years, even centuries. We are aware of Kyrgyzstan’s efforts to preserve the Russian language in the country. About 13,000 students are currently enrolled at Russian universities, 10,000 of them are studying free of charge, which is funded out of Russia’s federal budget. We are ready to talk about expanding our humanitarian cooperation. Last year Kyrgyzstan successfully held the Days of Russian Culture, and now the Days of Kyrgyz Culture are about to open in Moscow. All of this will certainly contribute to the development of long-term allied relations. We are aware of our partners’ intentions and their aspiration to deepen cooperation with such integration associations in the post-Soviet space as the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space. The President of Kyrgyzstan and I discussed this in detail today and yesterday evening in an informal setting. We will support Kyrgyzstan’s efforts to join these integration associations. It is not a simple matter, but given Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation and the fact that our integration associations – the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space – comply with WTO rules and regulations, I think it creates additional, good prerequisites for the entry of the Kyrgyz Republic in these associations. I want to thank President Atambayev, all of our Kyrgyz partners and friends for their hospitality and for their fruitful and very effective work in the recent period. Thank you for your attention. Question: A question for President Atambayev. You mentioned the signing of breakthrough bilateral agreements, one of which no doubt was on the terms of the Russian military base’s stay in Kyrgyzstan. Could you please say if the issue of the US base in Kyrgyzstan was raised during the talks, and in what context and how this discussion took place? Could you explain what status [the Transit Centre at] Manas will have, since this topic has been on the agenda for a long time? Mr Putin, you have just talked about the history of the Russian military base in Kyrgyzstan. What would you say are the strategic objectives of our base in Kyrgyzstan? Almazbek Atambayev: The US base was not discussed in our talks because it is a US base. But I will say this: since 2010, first as First Deputy Prime Minister of the interim Government, then as Prime Minister in 2011 and as President, I have always said that the Manas civilian airport should be a civilian airport. It is a civilian airport, and we will reformat it into a normal civilian airport – a cargo/passenger hub. But it is not an air base of any country; it is a civilian airport and it will be a civilian airport from 2014. I have never concealed this, I discussed this openly with everyone, including representatives of the US Government. Vladimir Putin: I would like to confirm that in the past two days we did not discuss or even mention the US military base or the US military presence here in Kyrgyzstan. It was not a subject of discussion; we did not talk about or even mention it. We talked about the Russian military base and the conditions under which it can and should operate. As for foreign military presence in Kyrgyzstan (be it Russian, American or otherwise), it is entirely the prerogative and the sovereign right of Kyrgyzstan. Should the US military leave Manas, Kyrgyzstan will naturally be interested in the airport’s continued operation, its economic benefits and profitability. In this case, we will be ready to get involved in the efforts to revitalise its economic performance. As for Russia’s military base and our military presence. Our military presence began — I want to remind you once again — on Kyrgyzstan’s request to establish a base here that would be an important stability factor in the region, in the republic, and would send a signal to all those who want to destabilise the situation in the country or the region that there is sufficient force here that could be deployed in the fight against extremism, drug trafficking and terrorism. We proceed from this in our actions. We are aware of the situation in Afghanistan, for example, and considering the situation with the international coalition forces in the near future, in 2014 the situation there is not likely to change for the better. The presence of Russia’s military component in the region, as in Tajikistan and here, in Kyrgyzstan, is an important stability factor. Question: Mr Putin, could you please say whether the Russian-Kyrgyz relations have reached a qualitatively new level of effective cooperation? Vladimir Putin: This is how we see it. Nearly 700,000 nationals of Kyrgyzstan live and work in Russia; in just the first six months of 2012 around one billion US Dollars was transferred to Kyrgyzstan, which is about 16% of GDP – a huge figure, but it is not the quality of cooperation that we need. What we need is equal cooperation, beneficial for both sides and fostering economic growth both in Russia and Kyrgyzstan. We have already said and I stated that Russia remains Kyrgyzstan's biggest trade partner, but the exchange of goods is not enough; we need large projects. Kyrgyzstan has a natural competitive advantage in the hydropower industry. A cascade of hydropower stations was built here in the past. There are also significant additional capabilities. This will not only expand cooperation in the region but we hope that it will have a positive impact on the region’s economic development, strengthen Kyrgyzstan’s role as an important element in energy supply of the entire Pacific region, bearing in mind that some of the energy can be sold, for example, to the neighbouring China. These are all very positive factors, and we are pleased that the agreements were signed today. Question: This is a question for both presidents. Our joint plans in the energy sector have caused some concern in neighbouring Uzbekistan. The concern is that Uzbekistan will receive less water as a result of construction. How do you plan to interact with Uzbekistan on this issue? Vladimir Putin: We have to address the concerns of all countries in the region, to bear this in mind and to act to resolve any doubts, to make sure that all concerns disappear.  Is that possible? Yes, it is. Under what conditions? Subject to mutual understanding and increased trust, and provided that any projects that are carried out in the region benefit all countries and all the people who live in these areas. Can we achieve this? Yes, we can. How? By inviting all the parties concerned to take part in the work. I believe that in order to make those concerns disappear, all the countries in the region should get directly involved in the implementation of these projects. We support the idea of inviting Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to join the projects. The President of Kyrgyzstan and I discussed this today and yesterday, and the Kyrgyzstani side supports this approach. We invite our partners to participate in the collaboration. This will include participation in the management of future hydropower enterprises that we are talking about today and whose operation may cause concern. President Atambayev and I have talked about it today and he said that these projects date back to the Soviet times. No one had any concerns then, bearing in mind that the projects were to be realised in a single state and there was no doubt that the state would never do anything to the detriment of some Soviet republics. What does this tell us? It tells us that if we establish the same rules for interaction and cooperation in the region, then there can be no threat from the realisation of such a project. Almazbek Atambayev: I would like to add a few technical details. Kambarata-1 was conceived as a water reservoir that would supply water in the summertime to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, because Kambarata-1 is supported by several existing hydropower stations: Shamaldy-Say, Uch-Kurgan and the famous Toktogul HPP. What happens now is that when we need electricity in the winter, we drain the reservoir, and in the summer we cannot supply water to our neighbours. If we build Kambarata-1, we will be able to drain the water in the winter, and keep it in Toktogul until the spring so that we can then supply it to our neighbours. That was how it was designed to work. The Kambarata-1 HPP was conceived to address the irrigation problems in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. And if someone says something different, they just don’t know what they are talking about. In fact, as President Putin said, it was designed in the Soviet Union in order to solve the irrigation problems in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. And I am confident we can sit down with the neighbours and discuss all the issues. It is our neighbours that need Kambarata-1 first and foremost. However, we understand their concerns and we are ready to work with them. We must live in peace and be friends with our neighbours. Vladimir Putin: In any case, I want to reiterate that we will pay attention to the concerns of all countries, including Uzbekistan, and remove all the issues that cause these concerns together with them. We can do it. Question: This is a question for the Russian President. Mr Putin, can you name a specific start date for the construction of the power stations? Are there concerns that Kambarata will be a replay of the Rogun HPP? Vladimir Putin: No one can give you a specific date but I can tell you about the stages of the project, which are as follows. First, we must do a feasibility study. The Russian partners will be responsible for most of this stage bearing in mind our financial capabilities and experience, but we will do it together with Kyrgyzstan. After that we will need to get an idea of the sales volume and the potential customers, we need to understand the market and to make calculations. It would be best if we conclude contracts for the supply of electricity. After that, the practical work on the site can begin.\", 'kremlin_id': 16509, 'place': 'Bishkek', 'title': 'Visit to Kyrgyzstan', 'teaser': 'In Bishkek, Vladimir Putin held talks with President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev.', 'tags': ['Foreign policy'], 'transcript_filtered': \"Yes, your very own. Mr President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, We are very satisfied with the work that has been done in recent months and the signing of key documents. First of all, they concern the financial settlements from the previous years between the Russian Federation and Kyrgyzstan. This creates a good basis for the expansion of trade and economic relations, and they are developing very positively. Last year, we posted an increase of 5%, with growth exceeding 30% in the first six months of 2012. I have already talked about this at our expanded meeting. Russia remains Kyrgyzstan’s main trade partner. New fundamental conditions for our cooperation have been created with the signing of the documents, not only those focused on financial relations, but also energy cooperation agreements. As you know, we have signed the agreements for the construction of Kambarata-1 HPP and the Upper Naryn cascade HPP. These are major, serious multi-billion projects, and I want to stress that they will contribute to Kyrgyzstan’s economic growth, create jobs and increase prosperity. We have also reached agreement on the operation of a joint military base in Kyrgyzstan. I think many people here in Kyrgyzstan remember how it was established. It was set up when terrorist gangs entered the territory of Kyrgyzstan. The Government of Kyrgyzstan turned to Russia to establish a military outpost here that would serve as a barrier against drug trafficking, drugs and extremism trying to enter Kyrgyzstan. We established the base and now we have agreed with the leadership of Kyrgyzstan to continue its operation. Certainly, this is a very important element that strengthens the trust between our two countries. I am sure many people know about our humanitarian cooperation. Kyrgyzstan and Russia worked and lived as part of a single state for many years, even centuries. We are aware of Kyrgyzstan’s efforts to preserve the Russian language in the country. About 13,000 students are currently enrolled at Russian universities, 10,000 of them are studying free of charge, which is funded out of Russia’s federal budget. We are ready to talk about expanding our humanitarian cooperation. Last year Kyrgyzstan successfully held the Days of Russian Culture, and now the Days of Kyrgyz Culture are about to open in Moscow. All of this will certainly contribute to the development of long-term allied relations. We are aware of our partners’ intentions and their aspiration to deepen cooperation with such integration associations in the post-Soviet space as the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space. The President of Kyrgyzstan and I discussed this in detail today and yesterday evening in an informal setting. We will support Kyrgyzstan’s efforts to join these integration associations. It is not a simple matter, but given Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation and the fact that our integration associations – the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space – comply with WTO rules and regulations, I think it creates additional, good prerequisites for the entry of the Kyrgyz Republic in these associations.

Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov: Mr President, we are completing the main phase of the Kavkaz 2012 strategic military exercises. The primary objectives were to check the cohesion of the Southern Military District’s strategic and tactical command and, accordingly, test automated control systems that are currently being implemented in the military. We worked at four firing ranges in the Southern Military District and two water zones in the Black and Caspian Seas. We also tested the new high-precision weaponry now installed on our vessels and, concordantly, our mobile armament and military equipment systems. Overall, I think we achieved the goals set as the main purpose of the exercises. We will analyse the outcomes on September 24. We want to award some officers, sergeants and soldiers. Some awards will be on behalf of the Defence Minister, others will be the Russian President’s awards. Vladimir Putin: In other words, some awards fall within your competence while others are subject to respective presidential executive orders. I shall be pleased to sign them. Indeed, this massive undertaking has been held at a very high organisational level and produced good results. The troops showed cohesiveness and efficacy in their operation. Overall, the training is not in vain, and everything done to advance modernisation, supply many new weapons and apply new tactics taking into account the new developments by the General Staff Academy and the General Staff itself is of great use. How does the General Staff assess these efforts? Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Federation’S Armed Forces Nikolai Makarov: Comrade Commander-in-Chief, I should add that a particular feature of the exercises was that the military district’s senior officers and strategic command were resolving two very serious challenges: planning troop management to settle domestic conflicts while simultaneously resolving the problem of responding to an external attack. In other words, these were two important strategic challenges which were essentially very difficult in and of themselves. I must say that the district successfully overcame this challenge, confidently managing troops and forces. The exercises were widespread taking place in all the water zones of the Black and Caspian Seas, and at numerous training grounds for terrestrial troops, where exercises were held for combat shooting as well as bilateral exercises. And the strategic, command operations and especially tactical commanders gained good experience. The brigade, battalion, and squadron commanders really showed an increased skill level and cohesion in all subdivisions. I believe they deserve a positive assessment. At the same time, we encountered certain problems. I think that we will resolve them within a year, and we will approach the next exercises with reduced problems and difficulties. Vladimir Putin: The exercises are held for the very purpose of not just taking stock of what has been done in terms of training, but also to reveal any weak spots or shortcomings, to come to conclusions and move forward, eliminating these problems and moving on. Please go ahead and make your suggestions regarding awards. The second issue is a purely social one. Training is right, good and necessary, and it is great that we have held these exercises. But one of the most pressing questions is the social issue pertaining to housing. We have already been working actively on this matter for some time, and we are allotting unprecedentedly significant funding for this purpose. We should be reaching the conclusion of this programme. How does it stand right now? Anatoly Serdyukov: Mr President, at the beginning of the year, we had a list of 54,000 service members entitled to receive permanent housing. Over the course of the year, we believe that eight to ten thousand more officers will gain this right. Vladimir Putin: This year? Anatoly Serdyukov: Yes, this year. Currently, we have already provided housing for 33,000 servicemen and are now commissioning and granting 1,500 to 1,600 apartments weekly. We have 21,000 more to do by the end of this year. According to the plans and contracts we have signed, we will be able to process almost all of those twenty-something thousand by the end of the year. We still have a small number of officers who have expressed a desire to live in Moscow. We had already signed corresponding contracts on building housing in Moscow as well, but by the end of the year only some of the apartment buildings will be commissioned, while others will likely be commissioned during the first quarter of 2013. In any case, we must essentially take care of the entire existing waiting-list, as well as those that will be added over the course of this year, by the end of the first half of 2013, and successfully meet the goal of providing housing to the military in accordance with the objective you set out for us. Around 2022–2023, we will be able to draw this programme entirely to a close in its current form. Vladimir Putin: I would like to draw your attention to two things. The first is the budgetary resources to resolve this problem, ensuring that there is enough money in this year’s budget, and especially in the 2013 budget – that sufficient funding is allocated to solve this problem. And second, as you know, is administrative support and the creation of necessary conditions to ensure processing and registering housing for the military in a timely manner with the fewest possible delays caused by excessive bureaucracy. I already asked you to open additional stations for processing the documents required. What has been done in this regard? Anatoly Serdyukov: We opened 37 additional registration stations. We have significantly reduced the list of documents that servicemen must present and have taken a large part of efforts on ourselves. This has greatly accelerated the process itself. As I already said, we are now working at a good rate of providing 1,650 apartments per week. If we maintain the pace through the end of the year then I think we should resolve this problem by the end of the year.

            "{'date': '2012-09-24T12:30:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': '* * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Belousov, you are aware of the situation that has emerged in several aluminium sector companies. I met with the companies owners, and I asked you to get personally involved in sorting out these rather serious economic and social issues. I know that some progress has been made since then.  Economic Development Minister Andrei Belousov     Belousov AndreiFirst Deputy Prime Minister : Yes, we are responsible for the aluminium industry, of course, though the social issues are above all matters for the company owners and their workforces. The owners are to settle these matters. But the aluminium industry is a strategic sector, and we are in the process of building new production facilities, including through loans from Vnesheconombank. It is understandable that the companies’ owners have problems right now because they have to fill new production capacities, the Boguchansk Aluminium Smelter and Taishet Aluminium Smelter, which we are currently building. They need people for this, and at the same time, they have to take the old production facilities out of operation. Several smelters have been affected, but the biggest problems were at the Bogoslovsky Aluminium Smelter. I say ‘were’ because I think the situation has been defused for the most part. This smelter has unique status owing to its place as one of the Soviet Union’s first aluminium smelters. It was built during the Great Patriotic War years and began producing aluminium in 1945.  At the same time, it is the most technologically obsolete smelter. It uses electrolysis units that cannot be upgraded and are not profitable to run now. Naturally, the owner’s first reaction was to lay off 1,200 smelter workers. The owner had no plans to close the plant down altogether, because there is also a fairly modern clay production facility there, but that is not the issue. The negotiations were quite tough. We acted as mediator between the smelter’s labour collective, the smelter’s home region – Sverdlovsk Region – and the company owners. We should give the owner – Rusal – its due, because they made energetic efforts to settle all the problems. I can now report that the situation was settled as follows: the owners and the labour collective, represented by the trade union and the governor, signed an agreement (the governor signed too), under which no one will be made redundant. Some of the employees will be moved to other facilities at the same smelter, and some of them will be offered packages for voluntary transfer to new production facilities at other locations. I stress that this will be voluntary. No one will be laid off by order. This is one of the agreement’s key points. Of course, Vnesheconombank’s assistance will be required here in terms of providing the loans needed to modernise the production facilities as rapidly as possible. We spent a long time discussing this and are working on it. Vladimir Putin: This is very important so that the smelter has a future. People need help, and they should be clear too about exactly what kind of help this will be and what form it will take.  Andrei Belousov: The trade union head and I agreed that he will monitor the agreement’s implementation, and I will also keep my finger on the pulse. Vladimir Putin: Good. What other developments do we have? Andrei Belousov: In the aluminium sector, there are two other smelters that have been hard-hit, but the situation there is not as serious. I am sure that we will be able to settle the problems here too.  Vladimir Putin: We had other issues on the agenda too. Andrei Belousov: Yes, I wanted to report that we have analysed the situation concerning forecasts for 2013–2015. The situation is quite complicated because we will need to maintain a growth rate of at least 4–5 percent, otherwise we will not be able to balance the budget, given the simultaneous defence spending and social spending commitments we have taken on so as to resolve the big issues that you set out in your executive orders. These are tasks that must be carried out. But this sets the minimum growth level. At the same time, there are several new factors that will come into play over this time. Probably the most complex among them – we do not have full understanding yet of all of its possible implications, and I think the public does not fully understand the situation yet – is that we are for the first time entering a period when our oil exports and oil production will not be growing. This will be quite a lengthy period. In other words, before the crisis in 2007, from the mid-2000s, exports of energy resources and other commodities drove around half of our economy’s growth, but now this growth driver will all but stop working. The other factor that we must also take into account… Vladimir Putin: There is the drop in consumption to consider too then. Andrei Belousov: Yes, this includes the drop in consumption too of course. The other factor that we must take into account is our economy’s adaptation to the WTO. Tariff protection will be substantially lower. Tariffs are coming down selectively, not across the board, but in specific areas, but we will nonetheless need to take protective measures in some sectors. We have already drafted and are implementing a programme for the different sectors’ adaptation. I reported to the State Duma on this programme, and we agreed to set up a special working group made up of Duma deputies, entrepreneurs, and government officials, to monitor the programme’s implementation. The working group will be established very soon, and I should be able to report on the progress in October, when some of the measures will already be fully carried out. One big issue that worries us today — analysis shows that it will be a key issue — is the need to increase investment and build up the share of reserves. I would not say that we are lacking the financial resources we need for this task. Russia, after all, has a gross national savings ratio of around 30 percent – one of the highest in the world. This is a lot. We have a lot of savings. These are not even so much household savings as those of companies. But we make poor use of this potential. A lot of capital goes abroad, and this is not always justified. It is understandable when companies are making investments, buying assets abroad, say. This is normal, something that big companies all around the world do. But it is not good when capital cannot find effective use at home. The key plan now in this area is the national business initiative that you instructed to start developing last December at the Delovaya Russia [Business Russia] forum. Quite detailed roadmaps were drafted, mostly through the business community’s own efforts. A large number of such roadmaps were drafted because the problem is a complex one and involves many different aspects. The first four roadmaps have already taken effect. They deal with the most sensitive areas: improving customs administration, construction regulations, connection to the electricity grid, and support for exports.  Now we have to put in place a system to monitor their implementation. In this respect, given that we are working together with the business community, the main innovation is something we cannot avoid, namely, that we cannot limit ourselves to bureaucratic oversight alone. In other words, simply drafting or even adopting a law or regulation will not suffice. For everything to work, the end consumers of these legislative efforts must see tangible results — feel for themselves that things are improving and the problems are being solved.  We are establishing a three-tier oversight system. The first tier is the standard bureaucratic monitoring procedure, which we already know well. The second tier is exercised through the working groups that drafted the roadmaps. One of the main requirements to those groups was that each should be headed by a businessperson. The third tier will be carried out through the leaders’ club which is being established with the help of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives, as its CEO Mr Andrei Nikitin reported to you. This club will bring together businesspeople from all around the country, from all the different regions, and we want to get them involved too, so as to monitor the changes taking place in their businesses, at the local level, and in the regions. We have already begun working with them and will meet once a month to hear their reports and get feedback. Vladimir Putin: Plan my meetings with them as before. As for the oil industry, your Ministry and the Energy Ministry, together with the CEOs of our main companies, need to ensure the conditions for developing new fields. Many old fields are depleted now, and we are to develop new ones, including the ones that are difficult to access.

Deputy Prime Minister DMITRY ROGOZIN     Rogozin DmitryGeneral Director of the Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities : Mr President, acting on your instructions, as chairman of the organising committee for the celebrations, we marked Armourers’s Day in the country for the first time and celebrated the 300th anniversary of the signing of Peter the Great’s decree to launch industrial armoury production in Russia. We organised big celebrations in Tula. There were events elsewhere too, but the main celebrations were in Tula. There were not only celebratory events, but business events too.  Our foreign partners sent delegations to take part in the celebrations. There were delegations from NATO member countries wanting to work together with us in the industry and undertake technology transfers with Russia’s defence industry, and India also sent a big delegation. Regarding the business part of the events, we held an extra-mural meeting of the Military Industrial Commission, which, following your instructions, made some very important decisions. The first decision was on industrial cooperation in developing hypersonic technology. The second decision was about the start of reorganisation in the firearms sector, and of course the public-private partnership aspect.  We noted that the decision you announced in Nizhny Tagil on May 12 on bringing private capital into the defence industry is starting to have an effect and has produced some first results. We see some initiatives and breakthroughs in the firearms sector, for example, the development of a new pistol and two new sniper rifles. These new models were developed by private business. They are currently going through state tests and I hope will be taken on by the armed forces.  Overall, despite the problems we all know well, problems such as technological backwardness that you have mentioned many times, the armourers are in a positive mood. They are ready to put their efforts and talents into reviving the industry and carrying out the state arms procurement programme. Vladimir Putin: I am not in such a positive mood yet, to be honest. We both know about the problems in the arms and ammunition manufacturing sectors. Yes, we certainly must work hard on technical modernisation and bringing in private money – I totally agree with you here. But we need a programme, and this programme is to be organised in such a way as to ensure that modernising the industry will go hand-in-hand with addressing the social issues, so that people are not forgotten. You know how serious an issue this is. The arms procurement programme should take the relevant measures in this respect and ensure support for the companies through state instruments and state guarantees.  Perhaps there are other possible support measures too, but without direct government support these companies are unlikely to be able to go through the restructuring process without serious losses, and losses are precisely what we want to avoid. We know, after all, that this sector has always played a vital part in ensuring our country’s defence capability, and must continue to do so after the modernisation measures end. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16527, 'place': 'Sochi', 'title': 'Working meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin', 'teaser': 'The defence industry’s development outlook was the subject of discussion.', 'tags': ['Armed Forces', 'National security'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Mr Rogozin, we just celebrated Armourers’ Day.

We know, after all, that this sector has always played a vital part in ensuring our country’s defence capability, and must continue to do so after the modernisation measures end. <…>', 'wordlist': ['Mr', 'Rogozin', ',', 'we', 'just', 'celebrate', 'Armourers', \"'\", 'Day', '.', ' ', 'I', 'know', 'that', 'you', 'take', 'part', 'in', 'the', 'event', 'to', 'mark', 'this', 'professional', 'holiday', 'and', 'meet', 'with', 'industry', 'representative', 'to', 'discuss', 'the', 'industry', '’s', 'development', 'prospect', 'and', 'the', 'defence', 'sector', '’s', 'outlook', '.', ' ', 'could', 'you', 'say', 'a', 'few', 'word', 'about', 'this', '?', 'I', 'be', 'not', 'in', 'such', 'a', 'positive', 'mood', 'yet', ',', 'to', 'be', 'honest', '.', ' ', 'we', 'both', 'know', 'about', 'the', 'problem', 'in', 'the', 'arm', 'and', 'ammunition', 'manufacturing', 'sector', '.', ' ', 'yes', ',', 'we', 'certainly', 'must', 'work', 'hard', 'on', 'technical', 'modernisation', 'and', 'bring', 'in', 'private', 'money', '–', 'I', 'totally', 'agree', 'with', 'you', 'here', '.', ' ', 'but', 'we', 'need', 'a', 'programme', ',', 'and', 'this', 'programme', 'be', 'to', 'be', 'organise', 'in', 'such', 'a', 'way', 'as', 'to', 'ensure', 'that', 'modernise', 'the', 'industry', 'will', 'go', 'hand', '-', 'in', '-', 'hand', 'with', 'address', 'the', 'social', 'issue', ',', 'so', 'that', 'people', 'be', 'not', 'forget', '.', ' ', 'you', 'know', 'how', 'serious', 'an', 'issue', 'this', 'be', '.', ' ', 'the', 'arm', 'procurement', 'programme', 'should', 'take', 'the', 'relevant', 'measure', 'in', 'this', 'respect', 'and', 'ensure', 'support', 'for', 'the', 'company', 'through', 'state', 'instrument', 'and', 'state', 'guarantee', '.', '  ', 'perhaps', 'there', 'be', 'other', 'possible', 'support', 'measure', 'too', ',', 'but', 'without', 'direct', 'government', 'support', 'these', 'company', 'be', 'unlikely', 'to', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'go', 'through', 'the', 'restructuring', 'process', 'without', 'serious', 'loss', ',', 'and', 'loss', 'be', 'precisely', 'what', 'we', 'want', 'to', 'avoid', '.', ' ', 'we', 'know', ',', 'after', 'all', ',', 'that', 'this', 'sector', 'have', 'always', 'play', 'a', 'vital', 'part', 'in', 'ensure', 'our', 'country', '’s', 'defence', 'capability', ',', 'and', 'must', 'continue', 'to', 'do', 'so', 'after', 'the', 'modernisation', 'measure', 'end', '.', ' ', '<', '…', '>']}\n",
            "{'date': '2012-09-25T18:15:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': 'The agenda focused on the relevant areas of modern cultural policy and support for creative initiatives, the preservation, use and promotion of Russia’s historical and cultural heritage, the future of humanities education, helping young people develop their creative potential, and improving the practice of international cultural cooperation. On September 19, the President signed Executive Order amending the Provisions on the Council for Culture and Art, and approved the new composition of the Council and its Presidium. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, colleagues, It has been a long time since the Council for Culture and Art met in such an expanded format. The last meeting was in May 2007. Meanwhile, there are many new issues and I am sure we will have a vigorous debate, especially since the Council has many new members. This is the first time that it includes representatives of public, non-profit organisations and the media, secondary education professionals, and many colleagues from the Russian regions. I stress that our objective was for the Council to reflect the diversity of Russia’s cultural environment. Before we proceed to the discussion, I would like to draw your attention to some issues that I think are particularly important. We must admit that our approach to culture remains sector-specific. We often forget that culture is an integral part of all aspects of our lives and cannot exist on its own, in isolation from society. A person is shaped primarily by the cultural environment, or the cultureless environment, as it sometimes happens, unfortunately. The collective portrait of our society directly depends on the quality of this cultural environment; it shapes us and our children. Throughout Russia’s history, culture educated and enriched our nation, it was the source of its spiritual experience and the basis for the consolidation of our multi-national people. To a large extent, culture built up Russia’s prestige and influence in the world, and objectively made it into a great power. We are mindful of this and should make efficient use of our humanitarian resources, increase international interest in our history, traditions, language and cultural values. We are proud of the Russian culture, its traditions and historical achievements. Culture is a living organism that is constantly evolving and needs an influx of new energy and a revitalising creative competition. National culture cannot be isolated; it should be constantly absorbing new phenomena, global trends and innovations. I think you will all agree with me that our national culture originally, from the outset, developed as multinational, as various peoples became part of the multinational Russian state, and throughout modern history, our culture has always been open to everything new in the world. However, along with the obvious cultural advances, we are increasingly confronted with cultural poverty, with all kinds of fakes and cultural fast food. This poses very serious risks. The main danger is that we may lose our cultural identity, our national cultural code, our moral core. This weakens and destroys society. Society that lacks cultural traditions is very easy to manipulate. It loses immunity to various extremist, destructive and even aggressive ideas. Unfortunately, the debate on this issue often focuses around the favourite Russian question “why?” and we should think more often about “what is to be done”. Today, many culture professionals are concerned about a decline in humanities subjects in the modern education system. I fully share this concern. The objective of schools, pre-schools and universities is not just to pass on knowledge and skills; they must focus on character-building, teach critical independent thinking, and mark a clear line between good and evil. I am convinced that the most important task of education is to shape a person’s spiritual culture and taste, the value systems and worldview. Another fundamental question is how to make our cultural policy the subject of a true partnership between the public and the state. Today we see many examples of sincere, honourable civic initiatives on the preservation of the national heritage. This position certainly deserves support. It should receive strong backing, including through such modern forms as state grants. This does not mean, however, that the burden and responsibility for these critical spheres should be shifted onto volunteers and community activists. Only the state can provide adequate funding for projects and maintain the incomes of culture professionals – the people whose job it is to preserve our cultural heritage and restore monuments – as well as to create the legal conditions for the expansion of the public-private partnership in this area. Earlier today the Prime Minister and I discussed incomes in the social sphere, and we have a common view on this issue. We can note with satisfaction the growth in incomes across the economy. At the end of last year, the average salary in the economy was around 24,000 [rubles], and this year will be about 26,800 [rubles]. There are monthly fluctuations but the figure will be somewhere around 27,000 [rubles]. The average for the culture sphere, however, will be around 12,800 [rubles] this year, which is almost half. That is certainly unfair. Next year we plan to increase salaries for all culture professionals by 6%, which corresponds to inflation. We have decided to increase the funding for culture to 4 billion rubles next year with the aim of raising salaries, and we plan to do this regardless of the numerous challenges facing the budget. This will allow us to make a significant step forward in this sphere, one that we have not made in the past years. On average, salaries will increase somewhere in the range of 30–33%, and this figure could be even higher if cultural institutions are efficiently restructured and optimised – and I am addressing all heads of cultural institutions. I urge you to act in this way – this does not mean that you should take abrupt measures without thinking it through, but I am sure experienced managers understand what I mean. Of course, we need to develop efficient mechanisms that would allow us to use historical and cultural heritage safely and effectively. I believe that we need to expedite the establishment of a clear system of state control and public monitoring of cultural heritage and on the whole move away from the protection of individual monuments to the comprehensive protection of historical cities and villages. Special attention should be devoted to small towns across Russia with their unique culture and spirit. Incidentally, this is a powerful resource for the development of the tourism industry, with its enormous potential for small and medium businesses, and the creation of thousands of new jobs. I ask the Culture Ministry to tackle these issues in close contact with the Council for Culture, and to prepare a government report on the state of cultural monuments, reflecting all the existing problems and proposals on how to resolve them. The report must be submitted to the Government in October and open to public discussion. I emphasise that we must make optimal use of such mechanisms as public control, expert assessment and debate in all areas that are as sensitive and crucial as the preservation of cultural and historical heritage. This is the objective requirement of the time, a conscious policy of engaging a maximum number of people in national affairs and making key strategic decisions. Modern information technologies make it possible to do this effectively. I believe that the work of state agencies must also be open and accessible as they join efforts with public organisations, including our Council and other Presidential councils governing humanitarian issues. They should provide feedback and help coordinate the interests of various professional and social groups. We could create a website that would provide updated information on the work of the councils, their achievements and progress made in implementing instructions. I propose that the Council for Culture should become a pioneer in this area, especially since many of those present have interesting initiatives, which we have previously discussed. I think they have great potential. I support the idea of establishing four committees as part of the Council for Culture. They will be responsible for the practical dimension of our work so that we don’t just meet once or twice a year and talk about abstract problems. Such four subcommittees could certainly be useful and I fully agree with the authors of this idea. We must attract the public, experts, and everyone who is interested and cares about these efforts. We should discuss the formats of the committees’ work and their priorities. <…>  ', 'kremlin_id': 16530, 'place': 'The Kremlin, Moscow', 'title': 'Meeting of Council for Culture and Art', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin held a meeting of the Presidential Council for Culture and Art.', 'tags': ['Culture'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, friends, colleagues, It has been a long time since the Council for Culture and Art met in such an expanded format.

We understand that much of it is the repatriation of capital, but nevertheless, Luxembourg is the third greatest investor in Russia. You have been presiding over the Euro Group for many years, and in this regard, it is very important for me to have the opportunity to meet with you personally, to discuss the problems in the eurozone with you, because the European Union remains our most important trade and economic partner. I know that you take the problems in the eurozone very close to heart, and I know how much you have personally done to improve the situation.

We would like to continue our cooperation with this region, which is currently developing actively. Relations between Russia and Luxembourg are excellent, in spite of our difference in size.

            "{'date': '2012-09-25T22:30:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': 'President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Today, Mr Juncker and I had a substantive conversation about key issues in our cooperation, as well as the international agenda. Cooperation between Russia and Luxembourg is developing successfully and may be certainly classified as partnership. We are maintaining regular, trust-based political dialogue and cooperating on a mutually beneficial basis in the trade, economy, science, technology, and in the humanitarian sector. Luxembourg is a major investor. Together with China and the Netherlands, it is one of the top three investors of capital into the Russian economy. The figure is quite high – 36.7 billion dollars. We are well aware that this is largely due to the repatriation of Russian capital. Nevertheless, if it passes through Luxembourg’s financial and banking system and returns to Russia’s economy then that, too, is positive. Among other areas, investments are being directed toward the implementation of new technologies and such important sectors of the Russian economy as infrastructure, communications, including satellite and space-based communications, the metallurgical industry and medicine. Innovative projects include producing energy efficient glass, developing joint pharmaceuticals and a host of others. Many of these are being implemented on a multilateral basis. Luxembourg’s banking circles are assisting in the development of Russia’s securities market and its full-fledged integration into global financial markets. This is a very important area of our cooperation. We will continue to broaden economic ties between Russia and Luxembourg. Our joint commission plays a special role in this process. Mr Juncker and I agreed that the new co-chairs from Russia and Luxembourg will hold another session of this commission soon. We intend to foster tight cooperation between Luxembourg and Russia’s regions. Already, a significant number of Russian regions are working directly with partners from Luxembourg. We know that during this current visit, Mr Prime Minister will go to the Republic of Tatarstan and Tambov Region. We are glad to see the development of cooperation on a regional scale. I am certain that it will benefit our bilateral relations. During our talks, we discussed the situation in the Eurozone. I am very grateful to Mr Juncker. Mr Prime Minister is not just the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, but also a major European politician (I am certain of this, and he knows that this is my point of view). He has presided over the Euro Group for many years – a group of which the finance and economic ministers are members. And naturally, it was very important for us to hear an assessment of the situation in the Eurozone from a direct source. We also touched on the problems in the relations between Russia and the EU. For our part, we emphasised our interest in transferring to a visa-free travel regime as quickly as possible. I am very pleased that Mr Prime Minister shares this approach. I hope that our other colleagues, including colleagues from the European Commission, will also work on implementing these joint goals more actively. I sincerely thank our colleagues from Luxembourg, all our colleagues and Mr Prime Minister personally, for today’s constructive dialogue and productive joint work. Thank you for your attention. Prime Minister of Luxembourg Jean-Claude Juncker     Juncker Jean-Claude  (retranslated): Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, the relations between Russia and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are excellent, just like the relations between the President of the Russian Federation and the Prime Minister of Luxembourg. We have been maintaining a rich dialogue for many years now. We have some disagreements as well as convergences in views. Ultimately, there are more similarities than differences. Thus, we discussed bilateral issues existing in our relations. I am very grateful to the President of Russia for his agreement to improve aerial service between our nations and, of course, our agencies will continue advancing in this regard. I thank the President of Russia for understanding Luxembourg’s concerns on eliminating visas. And we fully understand Russia’s position, since this issue must be resolved adequately, taking into account the ambitious objectives that stand before Russia and the European Union in their cooperation. And I am very happy that the State Duma will be ratifying the agreement on avoiding double taxation between Russia and Luxembourg this October, as the President told me. We spent a long time discussing problems pertaining to issues that are still unresolved with regard to the Eurozone’s debt burden. As the president of the Euro Group, I thank Russia for its policies demonstrating loyalty and consistency toward the Eurozone, which is of decisive importance for us. We also talked about the situation in the region. Russia is an important regional player in this, shall we say, complicated region of the world. Moreover, we discussed the issue of human rights in Russia and other countries. In addition, we spoke about issues regarding the situations in Syria and Afghanistan. I thank Russian President Vladimir Putin for finding the time for today’s meeting, which serves as another testament to our friendship. Question: Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, I have several questions: on Syria, the tensions between China and Japan, and on the Eurozone, but I will stick to one question and ask you about human rights. You said that you and Mr Putin discussed at the start of your meeting the things the Russian federal government intends to and should do to improve the human rights situation in Russia, taking into account the criticism from organisations such as Human Rights Watch and European parliamentarians’ groups.  Jean-Claude Juncker (retranslated): Yes, I have discussed the human rights issue with the Russian President during our personal meetings and our telephone conversations. To be honest, I do not like to lecture others on human rights, but I do discuss the issue. I want to make myself clearly understood on this point: in order to play an effective part in helping to resolve these problems I am happy to discuss such issues, but not at news conferences. We did discuss these matters, raised the question, but, frankly, I do not want to repeat everything we said here before you now. I think it is sufficient for you to know that we did discuss this issue.  Vladimir Putin: Yes, we did talk about this matter. Mr Juncker and I have known each other for a long time now, and I think he would agree that we have good and friendly relations. He is frank in sharing with me his point of view on all the various issues, including human rights issues, and we discuss things openly and freely, without any limitations.  As for international human rights organisations’ assessments, they make various assessments about the situation in many different countries. I have already given some examples. It is enough to look at their assessments of the prison system, say, in some of the European Union countries. We all see the things that are going on there. We have problems here in Russia too. My only objection is that attention should not focus on Russia’s problems alone. There are common problems that we share. In many Muslim countries now, for example, people are protesting against the release of an anti-Islamic film that they see as a violation of their rights. I have not heard about anyone being punished for this. There are always going to be differences in understanding about where to draw the lines between the natural limits that specific cultural, historical and traditional frameworks place on human rights, and the rights that should be universally recognised and upheld without any limitation and universal common moral and spiritual values that we must all defend and protect. My basic position is that Russia does have problems in this area, as do all countries, and we always discuss them openly with our partners, including with Mr Juncker. Question: My question is for both leaders and concerns one of the issues you discussed, namely, the Eurozone’s problems. Mr Junkcer, as a specialist and one of the people most closely involved in this matter, how do you see the outlook as far as the crisis goes? How likely is it that it will worsen, and what possible solutions do you see? Mr Putin, in this respect, my question for you is: should Russia be worried about its assets? How big is the risk to Russian assets? And I’d like to tack on a question about relations with Europe, only of a more indirect kind. As things stand at the moment, Russia abolished daylight saving and stayed on winter time, but this creates communication problems as it puts us on different time. There has been a lot of talk in Russia lately about going back to summer time. Could you tell us your point of view? Are you for or against this idea? Jean-Claude Juncker (retranslated): Friends, I think this issue does not really concern Luxembourg. Time zones and the problems of time zone differences do not affect us because of our country’s small size, so, if you don’t mind, I will not answer this question.  Regarding the Eurozone, as I explained to the President and the Prime Minister, those who think that the Eurozone is about to collapse soon are severely mistaken. The Eurozone partners are strongly committed to keeping the common currency and maintaining the zone’s financial stability. We are a lot stronger than we look, and are ready to battle any difficulties we may encounter on the way. We are better prepared than we were a few years ago. We have put in place a financial stability mechanism, which I will announce on October 8 as an officially launched programme. This instrument will enable us to respond to immediate short-term risks and fluctuations that could negatively impact our financial stability. I am absolutely certain that we can and must guarantee the Eurozone’s financial stability, and I know we are up to the task. I am not saying that this will be easy, but I can say honestly that this is our objective and we are putting all our hopes and efforts into this work. Vladimir Putin: On the question of our assets, our gold and currency reserves, it is true that we keep a substantial share of these reserves in euros (slightly less than half, but this is the biggest share). We are fully aware of the risks, but we take the view that the European economy’s fundamentals – and this is the most important thing in the end – are solid enough to maintain the common currency in place. At any rate, we see the European Commission and the Eurozone’s key actors’ determination to improve the situation, and we have confidence in their policies. On the daylight savings debate, I have not been following these discussions just of late, but I am aware of the attention Russian public opinion has been giving this issue. As we know, Mr Medvedev made this decision when he was President. I discussed the matter with him recently, and he is willing to change that decision, but the question is simply a matter of how best to go about the change. This matter came up during the election campaign too, and I said then and say again now that we will analyse the whole situation once more, look at how the decision that was taken has worked in practice, and then, without haste and fuss, we will make a final decision. The decision will be made at the Government Cabinet level. I think this would be the best and most proper way to go about resolving this problem.

We have been maintaining a rich dialogue for many years now. We have some disagreements as well as convergences in views. Ultimately, there are more similarities than differences. Thus, we discussed bilateral issues existing in our relations. I am very grateful to the President of Russia for his agreement to improve aerial service between our nations and, of course, our agencies will continue advancing in this regard. I thank the President of Russia for understanding Luxembourg’s concerns on eliminating visas. And we fully understand Russia’s position, since this issue must be resolved adequately, taking into account the ambitious objectives that stand before Russia and the European Union in their cooperation. And I am very happy that the State Duma will be ratifying the agreement on avoiding double taxation between Russia and Luxembourg this October, as the President told me. We spent a long time discussing problems pertaining to issues that are still unresolved with regard to the Eurozone’s debt burden. As the president of the Euro Group, I thank Russia for its policies demonstrating loyalty and consistency toward the Eurozone, which is of decisive importance for us. We also talked about the situation in the region. Russia is an important regional player in this, shall we say, complicated region of the world. Moreover, we discussed the issue of human rights in Russia and other countries. In addition, we spoke about issues regarding the situations in Syria and Afghanistan. I thank Russian President Vladimir Putin for finding the time for today’s meeting, which serves as another testament to our friendship. Yes, we did talk about this matter. Mr Juncker and I have known each other for a long time now, and I think he would agree that we have good and friendly relations. He is frank in sharing with me his point of view on all the various issues, including human rights issues, and we discuss things openly and freely, without any limitations. As for international human rights organisations’ assessments, they make various assessments about the situation in many different countries. I have already given some examples. It is enough to look at their assessments of the prison system, say, in some of the European Union countries. We all see the things that are going on there. We have problems here in Russia too. My only objection is that attention should not focus on Russia’s problems alone. There are common problems that we share. In many Muslim countries now, for example, people are protesting against the release of an anti-Islamic film that they see as a violation of their rights. I have not heard about anyone being punished for this. There are always going to be differences in understanding about where to draw the lines between the natural limits that specific cultural, historical and traditional frameworks place on human rights, and the rights that should be universally recognised and upheld without any limitation and universal common moral and spiritual values that we must all defend and protect. My basic position is that Russia does have problems in this area, as do all countries, and we always discuss them openly with our partners, including with Mr Juncker. On the question of our assets, our gold and currency reserves, it is true that we keep a substantial share of these reserves in euros (slightly less than half, but this is the biggest share). We are fully aware of the risks, but we take the view that the European economy’s fundamentals – and this is the most important thing in the end – are solid enough to maintain the common currency in place. At any rate, we see the European Commission and the Eurozone’s key actors’ determination to improve the situation, and we have confidence in their policies. On the daylight savings debate, I have not been following these discussions just of late, but I am aware of the attention Russian public opinion has been giving this issue. As we know, Mr Medvedev made this decision when he was President. I discussed the matter with him recently, and he is willing to change that decision, but the question is simply a matter of how best to go about the change. This matter came up during the election campaign too, and I said then and say again now that we will analyse the whole situation once more, look at how the decision that was taken has worked in practice, and then, without haste and fuss, we will make a final decision. The decision will be made at the Government Cabinet level. I think this would be the best and most proper way to go about resolving this problem. Thank you.', 'wordlist': ['good', 'evening', ',', 'lady', 'and', 'gentleman', '.', ' ', 'today', ',', 'Mr', 'Juncker', 'and', 'I', 'have', 'a', 'substantive', 'conversation', 'about', 'key', 'issue',

It is in our common interest that you be effective and successful in this work. You are taking the head of your embassies at a time when the situation in the world is becoming ever more troubled and unstable, regrettably. Global finances and the global economy face increasing problems, and, unfortunately, the crisis is taking on a protracted and systemic nature.  The United Nations General Assembly began just recently. Given the current complicated situation in international affairs this is a good moment to remember the UN Charter’s importance, which remains as valid as ever. The UN Charter sets out the principles for collectively managing international relations and establishing a fair and just world order that respects all countries’ sovereignty and equality. These principles guide us to settle all problems through negotiations, without resorting to outside intervention.  Strict adherence to these principles is needed more than ever today. The supremacy of the law should be as guaranteed in the international arena as it is within countries themselves. This directly concerns the events taking place in the world’s ‘hot spots’, above all in the Middle East and North Africa. Various forms of instigation and continued violence with the aim of forcing regime change will only drive the situation into a dead end. Violence breeds only more violence. We see the solution in coordinated action by the international community to settle crises through peaceful political and diplomatic means and encourage the conflicting parties to end armed violence. Human life is the greatest value of all and must not become the currency of exchange in geopolitical games. We consider it essential to bolster joint efforts to prevent terrorist threats and extremism no matter where they occur, be it in Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Egypt, or Afghanistan. There is no room for double standards here. Terrorists must be given firm and unanimous resistance. At the same time, we should respect each people’s cultural values and religious feelings. Multi-ethnic and multi-faith Russia’s entire history shows that there is no alternative to the path of preserving civil peace and harmony in society.  Let me stress again that basing ourselves on international law is the only possible way to conduct affairs in the modern world. No good comes out of attempts to substitute unilateral or bloc-based action for the universal principles in the UN Charter, or to bypass the Charter and use force.  Such actions carry the risk of destabilisation and chaos, and in such circumstances no crisis management is possible. Events of late have once more confirmed that our view is correct. It is time to learn the lessons from what is going on.  There are ambassadors here from countries whose leaders took part in the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum’s summit in Vladivostok. Let me say that we are happy with the results of our work together in Vladivostok. We succeeded in laying a decent base for continued efforts to develop trade and investment activity, transport infrastructure, ensure food security, and encourage innovation.  I draw particular attention to the importance of the integration underway between Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. The Customs Union, the Common Economic Space, and the future Eurasian Economic Union have great potential indeed. Russia will preside over a number of leading international forums over the coming years, including the G20, G8, BRICS, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. We will do everything we can to strengthen positive trends in the global economy and in global affairs.  Overall, we will continue actively implementing a foreign policy built on openness and unity. How this policy will be perceived and interpreted in your capitals depends in large part on you, as the heads of your countries’ diplomatic missions. I hope that you will follow developments in Russia and give an objective assessment of events here.  Ladies and gentlemen, we place great value on our cooperation with the Kingdom of Thailand, which forms the basis for the sincere friendship between our peoples and our rich experience of working together in trade and the economy. I had a useful meeting in Vladivostok with Prime Minister Shinawatra, and we agreed to intensify our ties. Mutual understanding is the distinguishing feature of Russia’s ties with Malta, which help to ensure stability in the Mediterranean and Europe.  The Republic of Peru is an important partner for Russia in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. I am sure that the results of the talks I had with President Humala in Vladivostok will help to deepen our bilateral contacts and relations. We seek to continue developing our cooperation with the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, with particular focus on promoting joint business projects. We are happy with the progress in our relations with the Republic of Singapore. These relations are gathering pace, especially in modernisation and innovation in the energy sector, human resources training, and managing special economic zones. Our cooperation with Bulgaria is built on the traditions of friendship and mutual sympathy between our peoples. Next year, we will celebrate together the 135th anniversary of Bulgaria’s liberation from the Ottoman yoke. We are carrying out big economic projects and are making the preparations for building the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline. Multifaceted cooperation and implementation of the important agreements we reached in Bishkek are on the agenda for our relations with Kyrgyzstan. I am sure that these agreements will not only deepen our strategic partnership but will also reinforce stability and security in Central Asia. Our relations with Finland are an example of true good-neighbourliness. We are expanding our trade and investment ties and conducting a trusting political dialogue. Our countries work constructively through the EU-Russia partnership and in the UN and international regional organisations in the Baltic, northern Europe, and the Arctic. We have a successfully developing strategic partnership and alliance with Kazakhstan. Deepening relations in this area and continuing this work are among our undoubted foreign policy priorities. Our countries actively encourage greater integration in the post-Soviet area. We are sure that the success of the project to build the Eurasian Economic Union will depend in large part on our ability to carry out these coordinated efforts. Our relations with the Federative Democratic Republic of Nepal are free of problems and based on similar interests and approaches to a wide range of regional and international issues. We support peaceful and constitutional development of the situation in Nepal. Our cooperation with Turkmenistan is becoming ever more substantial in political, trade, economic, and investment relations, and also in the cultural and humanitarian sphere. We are preparing for the CIS summit that will take place in early November in Ashgabat. Building relations with the young Republic of South Sudan is an important part of Russia’s efforts to contribute to development in Africa. We hope that the establishment and development of South Sudan and its economy will create many opportunities for carrying out joint projects. The peoples of Russia and Montenegro have a longstanding friendship. Our bilateral relations are developing fast. In particular, Russian capital is actively entering Montenegro’s economy, and the number of Russian tourists visiting your country is growing. We see good opportunities for intensifying relations with Brunei-Darussalam. Given that Brunei will preside in ASEAN in 2013, we hope for an intensive exchange of views on regional security and sustainable development issues. We place great importance on our relations with the Federative Republic of Nigeria, which plays a big part on the African continent. We are ready to expand and deepen our contacts, including in preventing terrorism and regional extremism. Our ties with Guatemala are increasing. We welcome Guatemala’s upcoming presidency of the UN Security Council in October and hope to work together on the current international issues. Relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina are an important part of Russia’s policy in the Balkans. As a guarantor of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia calls for strict compliance with the agreement, which we see as the departure point for building a modern and democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have laid good foundations for economic cooperation, especially in the energy sector.  We have a special fraternal relationship with Belarus, our close neighbour and dependable partner. Our intensive cooperation within the Union State and the integration bodies in the post-Soviet area aims to make our economies more competitive and give our peoples a better quality of life. We are ready to continue deepening our multifaceted and trusting ties and dialogue with Minsk and will work together on the international agenda. We will develop our ties with the Republic of Honduras in the interest of stability in the Central American region.  This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations with the Republic of Niger. I am sure that our positive cooperation experience will be put to use to intensify our work together. We are ready to continue building up our bilateral ties with Burkina Faso in a constructive and mutually advantageous spirit, and we welcome this country’s decision to open an embassy in Moscow. Ladies and gentlemen, You represent 21 countries from almost all continents: Asia, Europe, America, and Africa. We value and treasure our good relations with each country. The Russian authorities will provide you with all possible help and support in your work. I hope that your time and your work in our country will be associated not just with busy activity, but will leave you with many pleasant memories too. I wish all of you success.

The United Nations General Assembly began just recently. Given the current complicated situation in international affairs this is a good moment to remember the UN Charter’s importance, which remains as valid as ever. The UN Charter sets out the principles for collectively managing international relations and establishing a fair and just world order that respects all countries’ sovereignty and equality. These principles guide us to settle all problems through negotiations, without resorting to outside intervention.  Strict adherence to these principles is needed more than ever today. The supremacy of the law should be as guaranteed in the international arena as it is within countries themselves. This directly concerns the events taking place in the world’s ‘hot spots’, above all in the Middle East and North Africa. Various forms of instigation and continued violence with the aim of forcing regime change will only drive the situation into a dead end. Violence breeds only more violence. We see the solution in coordinated action by the international community to settle crises through peaceful political and diplomatic means and encourage the conflicting parties to end armed violence. Human life is the greatest value of all and must not become the currency of exchange in geopolitical games. We consider it essential to bolster joint efforts to prevent terrorist threats and extremism no matter where they occur, be it in Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Egypt, or Afghanistan. There is no room for double standards here. Terrorists must be given firm and unanimous resistance. At the same time, we should respect each people’s cultural values and religious feelings. Multi-ethnic and multi-faith Russia’s entire history shows that there is no alternative to the path of preserving civil peace and harmony in society.  Let me stress again that basing ourselves on international law is the only possible way to conduct affairs in the modern world. No good comes out of attempts to substitute unilateral or bloc-based action for the universal principles in the UN Charter, or to bypass the Charter and use force.  Such actions carry the risk of destabilisation and chaos, and in such circumstances no crisis management is possible. Events of late have once more confirmed that our view is correct. It is time to learn the lessons from what is going on.  There are ambassadors here from countries whose leaders took part in the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum’s summit in Vladivostok. Let me say that we are happy with the results of our work together in Vladivostok. We succeeded in laying a decent base for continued efforts to develop trade and investment activity, transport infrastructure, ensure food security, and encourage innovation.  I draw particular attention to the importance of the integration underway between Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. The Customs Union, the Common Economic Space, and the future Eurasian Economic Union have great potential indeed. Russia will preside over a number of leading international forums over the coming years, including the G20, G8, BRICS, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. We will do everything we can to strengthen positive trends in the global economy and in global affairs.  Overall, we will continue actively implementing a foreign policy built on openness and unity. How this policy will be perceived and interpreted in your capitals depends in large part on you, as the heads of your countries’ diplomatic missions. I hope that you will follow developments in Russia and give an objective assessment of events here.  Ladies and gentlemen, we place great value on our cooperation with the Kingdom of Thailand, which forms the basis for the sincere friendship between our peoples and our rich experience of working together in trade and the economy. I had a useful meeting in Vladivostok with Prime Minister Shinawatra, and we agreed to intensify our ties. Mutual understanding is the distinguishing feature of Russia’s ties with Malta, which help to ensure stability in the Mediterranean and Europe.  The Republic of Peru is an important partner for Russia in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. I am sure that the results of the talks I had with President Humala in Vladivostok will help to deepen our bilateral contacts and relations. We seek to continue developing our cooperation with the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, with particular focus on promoting joint business projects. We are happy with the progress in our relations with the Republic of Singapore. These relations are gathering pace, especially in modernisation and innovation in the energy sector, human resources training, and managing special economic zones. Our cooperation with Bulgaria is built on the traditions of friendship and mutual sympathy between our peoples. Next year, we will celebrate together the 135th anniversary of Bulgaria’s liberation from the Ottoman yoke. We are carrying out big economic projects and are making the preparations for building the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline. Multifaceted cooperation and implementation of the important agreements we reached in Bishkek are on the agenda for our relations with Kyrgyzstan. I am sure that these agreements will not only deepen our strategic partnership but will also reinforce stability and security in Central Asia. Our relations with Finland are an example of true good-neighbourliness. We are expanding our trade and investment ties and conducting a trusting political dialogue. Our countries work constructively through the EU-Russia partnership and in the UN and international regional organisations in the Baltic, northern Europe, and the Arctic. We have a successfully developing strategic partnership and alliance with Kazakhstan. Deepening relations in this area and continuing this work are among our undoubted foreign policy priorities. Our countries actively encourage greater integration in the post-Soviet area. We are sure that the success of the project to build the Eurasian Economic Union will depend in large part on our ability to carry out these coordinated efforts. Our relations with the Federative Democratic Republic of Nepal are free of problems and based on similar interests and approaches to a wide range of regional and international issues. We support peaceful and constitutional development of the situation in Nepal. Our cooperation with Turkmenistan is becoming ever more substantial in political, trade, economic, and investment relations, and also in the cultural and humanitarian sphere. We are preparing for the CIS summit that will take place in early November in Ashgabat. Building relations with the young Republic of South Sudan is an important part of Russia’s efforts to contribute to development in Africa. We hope that the establishment and development of South Sudan and its economy will create many opportunities for carrying out joint projects. The peoples of Russia and Montenegro have a longstanding friendship. Our bilateral relations are developing fast. In particular, Russian capital is actively entering Montenegro’s economy, and the number of Russian tourists visiting your country is growing. We see good opportunities for intensifying relations with Brunei-Darussalam. Given that Brunei will preside in ASEAN in 2013, we hope for an intensive exchange of views on regional security and sustainable development issues. We place great importance on our relations with the Federative Republic of Nigeria, which plays a big part on the African continent. We are ready to expand and deepen our contacts, including in preventing terrorism and regional extremism. Our ties with Guatemala are increasing. We welcome Guatemala’s upcoming presidency of the UN Security Council in October and hope to work together on the current international issues. Relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina are an important part of Russia’s policy in the Balkans. As a guarantor of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia calls for strict compliance with the agreement, which we see as the departure point for building a modern and democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have laid good foundations for economic cooperation, especially in the energy sector.  We have a special fraternal relationship with Belarus, our close neighbour and dependable partner. Our intensive cooperation within the Union State and the integration bodies in the post-Soviet area aims to make our economies more competitive and give our peoples a better quality of life. We are ready to continue deepening our multifaceted and trusting ties and dialogue with Minsk and will work together on the international agenda. We will develop our ties with the Republic of Honduras in the interest of stability in the Central American region.  This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations with the Republic of Niger. I am sure that our positive cooperation experience will be put to use to intensify our work together. We are ready to continue building up our bilateral ties with Burkina Faso in a constructive and mutually advantageous spirit, and we welcome this country’s decision to open an embassy in Moscow. Ladies and gentlemen, You represent 21 countries from almost all continents: Asia, Europe, America, and Africa. We value and treasure our good relations with each country. The Russian authorities will provide you with all possible help and support in your work. I hope that your time and your work in our country will be associated not just with busy activity, but will leave you with many pleasant memories too. I wish all of you success.

            "{'date': '2012-09-27T14:45:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': \"*** President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, Mr Prime Minister. I understand that the work on the budget is nearing completion? Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev     Medvedev DmitryDeputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation : That’s right, Mr President, the Government has completed the task. The budget will be finished and submitted to the State Duma within the next couple of days. The work was very intense over the past few days; one of our priorities was to incorporate the ideas that were voiced at the Government meeting on a number of items, including some social issues, such as the wages of faculty members at universities. We considered a number of options to generate additional revenues (I will brief you in detail later). There are some opportunities that give us room for manoeuvre. However, I must admit that the budget is very tight, both for 2013 and for the 2014 and 2015 planning period. I think we should hold a meeting to calculate everything to the last penny, which may actually be a positive factor that will serve to strengthen fiscal discipline at the federal level, as well as in regions and municipalities. Vladimir Putin: Yes, as you know, I have discussed this with our colleagues. This is the first budget of the new Government, the first budget of the new Finance Minister, and it is a very important event for the whole team and its individual members, and for the whole country. This is the nation’s main financial document for next year, Russia’s chief financial law. Indeed, the budget is very difficult, very complex. I believe that the budget rule adopted by the Government reflects the objective state of our economy, and we must do everything we can to adhere to it. That is why the budget is so tight. I also want to thank you and the colleagues in the Government for finding ways to address the most pressing social issues, including, for example, higher wages for the cultural sphere. The budget is very tight, and some may say in certain areas it is too tight, yet we have found a way to make a step forward and provide support in the areas where the most pressing social issues remain unresolved, especially in this sector that is vitally important for our nation, and it has people working there for very little money. They can by right be called selfless enthusiasts. You and I are both aware of what is happening in the developed economies that were thriving until recently, including those in Europe. They don’t increase funding for anything; it’s all about consolidation, cuts in social spending and raising the retirement age. The most recent and highly visible events are unfolding in Spain. We must bear in mind all the risks that affect our economy, the global and European economy, but we must also do everything to fulfil our social commitments. Judging from the draft budget, it was built around these priorities. Dmitry Medvedev: That is absolutely true. The budget is tight but it has retained its focus on social issues, which we have successfully achieved for the past 12 years. And every budget incorporated all of the Government’s social obligations, whatever the situation when it was calculated – I remember drawing up the budget for 2009 and 2010, when we were facing even greater challenges. It has been the same this time, despite adherence to the budget rule you have mentioned. It is true that we are using this rule for the first time. It caused a lot of controversy, but it provides a guarantee against any sudden changes in the hydrocarbon market. Unfortunately, our economy is very dependent on oil and gas prices, and this provides a kind of insurance for our country in case the global macroeconomic environment worsens, that is, if there is a downturn in the global economy. Vladimir Putin: We have already talked about social issues, and I am glad that the Government has found an opportunity to address these priorities. However, although the budget is clearly focused on social programmes, it should also be a development budget. I know that the Government has found a way to reinvest in our Direct Investments Fund, which plays a major part in the development of our economy, especially in innovation. That is the first point. The second priority is to provide support for export-oriented and high-tech industries, and implement protective measures pertaining to Russia’s accession to the WTO. I think that these are the key aspects of economic development that must be taken into consideration. Dmitry Medvedev: The budget reflects all of this. Indeed, the Direct Investments Fund was established to invest in the most important sectors, including high-tech, which you mentioned. The funding has been allocated and the protective measures related to Russia's membership in the World Trade Organisation have been planned. It was our goal to join it for a long time and we took great efforts, but WTO accession must not be accompanied by a collapse in some sectors of our economy. That is why we have made significant allocations to support farmers as part of the Agriculture Development Programme until 2020, and we have increased the funding. Incidentally, we have retained the zero interest rate on loans to farmers, and we have made it permanent. Other vulnerable industries must also obtain support through budgetary financing and loans. That includes automobiles and aircraft building, and some other sectors. Vladimir Putin: The Direct Investments Fund was established on your initiative, wasn’t it? Dmitry Medvedev: That’s right.

I understand that the work on the budget is nearing completion? Yes, as you know, I have discussed this with our colleagues. This is the first budget of the new Government, the first budget of the new Finance Minister, and it is a very important event for the whole team and its individual members, and for the whole country. This is the nation’s main financial document for next year, Russia’s chief financial law. Indeed, the budget is very difficult, very complex. I believe that the budget rule adopted by the Government reflects the objective state of our economy, and we must do everything we can to adhere to it. That is why the budget is so tight. I also want to thank you and the colleagues in the Government for finding ways to address the most pressing social issues, including, for example, higher wages for the cultural sphere. The budget is very tight, and some may say in certain areas it is too tight, yet we have found a way to make a step forward and provide support in the areas where the most pressing social issues remain unresolved, especially in this sector that is vitally important for our nation, and it has people working there for very little money. They can by right be called selfless enthusiasts. You and I are both aware of what is happening in the developed economies that were thriving until recently, including those in Europe.

The President also instructed Mr Manturov     Manturov DenisIndustry and Trade Minister  to prepare a meeting on developing the aircraft manufacturing industry.  * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Manturov, in 2006, we launched a programme to build a new Russian transport plane. We attempted to organise relations with our partners then, but without success, and we then decided to shift the entire production process to one of our plants in Ulyanovsk.  I know that the project has reached an advanced stage now and the aircraft has already made flights. What is the current situation? How do you assess the project? What stage are things at now? Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov: Mr President, we are currently in the final stage of work on the Il-76. We did indeed decide in 2006 to shift production from Tashkent to Russia. In the end, we did not so much simply shift production as create a whole new production process, which has resulted in a plane with new tactical and technical features.  The plane has been completely digitalised and changes have been made to its design, equipment, and control system. It has been fitted with a new engine – the PS-90A-76, produced in series at the Perm Engine Company. Vladimir Putin: Is this the same as the engine the Il-96 uses? Denis Manturov: Yes, that’s right. It’s a modified version of that engine. The plane has been fitted with a new pilot navigation system. The indicators have all been changed over to liquid crystal displays, the cockpit now uses modern digital glass, and changes have been made to the wing design and the landing gear. Vladimir Putin: We agreed that the plane has to meet completely new parameters for flight range, payload capacity, and fuel efficiency. Denis Manturov: Mr President, the plane’s characteristics are very good. There is a 25-percent increase in flight range, a 15-percent increase in payload capacity, and a 15–17-percent increase in fuel efficiency. We have spurred development not only in the aircraft manufacturing industry but in related sectors too. In particular, we plan to buy at least 500 engines as part of this programme’s implementation (that is, within the framework of the State Arms Procurement Programme alone). The project will have benefits for other industrial sectors too.  We are actively putting together the order package now. The primary orders will come from the Defence Ministry of course, once the tactical and technical specifications it set have been confirmed. I think that orders will start coming from other quarters too, from Russian state agencies, transport companies, and also from customers abroad with potential interest in buying this plane. We have already done some speed tests and had the plane in the air twice on short flights. Everything went absolutely normally on the flights. We will be ready for the first real test flight very soon. Vladimir Putin: I congratulate everyone working on this project: the pilots, engineers, specialists, and organisers. This is excellent news to hear. Now you just need to see it all through to its conclusion. There are very few planes with such features and with this kind of payload capacity in the world. This plane will be very useful in both the civilian and military sectors. The Defence Ministry needs this plane, as you know well. You will now need to work all the details regarding organising its purchase with the Defence Ministry.  Denis Manturov: We are working on this and are in the process of finalising the contract details with the Defence Ministry under the State Arms Procurement Programme. Vladimir Putin: The important thing is that the price should fit the product and its quality and be competitive with other planes of this class. Although, as I just said, such planes are probably…  Denis Manturov: There are two planes in this class, ours, and an American plane. But ours is a completely modernised plane with new tactical and technical characteristics. A good base has been laid and the prospects ahead are bright. Vladimir Putin: Good. Denis Manturov: The Il-76 is a good example of successfully combining the base laid during the Soviet years with modern technology and knowledge. We need to move further and develop new competitive products. Unfortunately, it is impossible to make progress without developing the related sectors at the same time. I am thinking above all here of the need for high-tech modern materials and rare earth metals. This is a matter not just of national security but developing modern new high-tech sectors, including in machine-building. Vladimir Putin: What is the plane called now, the Il-476? Denis Manturov: The project code is 476. Vladimir Putin: I want you to prepare a meeting to discuss further development of the aircraft manufacturing sector.

            "{'date': '2012-09-29T20:00:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': '* * * Channel One Russia anchor Andrei Malakhov: There are less than two hours to go now before the envelopes are opened and the Soccer World Cup host cities are named. Of the three huge events that the whole world watches, the first is the Olympic Games, the second is the Soccer World Cup, and the third is Eurovision. Russia will host the Olympics in 18 months’ time. You have a connection to Russia’s bids for both the Olympics and the Soccer World Cup, and so I want to ask you, what does holding the World Cup in Russia actually mean to you?  President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Above all, it is an excellent opportunity for us to get a lot more young people interested in sport, get them hooked on sport rather than on drink and cigarettes. We have been putting much more attention into sports programmes of late, and this is a justified policy given the demographic problems we face and the need to improve our people’s health. These kinds of big competitions offer a real chance to get young people involved in sport.  Andrei Malakhov: When Russia was announced as the host country for the 2018 World Cup, you were risking your reputation in a way, given that Russia had not so long before won the right to host the Olympics in Sochi. In bidding for this new event, weren’t you worried that Russia’s chances of winning might not be so good? Vladimir Putin: We started this whole process quite a long time ago. We began setting our sights on it back in 2005. It was then that we had our first discussions on the matter with the FIFA officials, with [FIFA President] Joseph Blatter and other sports organisers at the international level. In 2008, we started actually carrying out our plans and made our bid, and in 2010 we were named as the host country. Of course, if you get involved in particular programmes and projects you always put your reputation on the line in the sense that things might not work out for reasons beyond your control, and I was fully aware of this aspect of course, fully aware of the possible risks. But at the same time, I have always believed – and practice supports me here – that it is right to take these risks, because the minute the issue of reputation starts taking precedence in the minds of people doing jobs such as mine, actual substance and action start taking second place and then we all end up losing out for sure. And so, while I was aware of the risks, there was no doubt in my mind that giving this bid our clear support was the right thing to do. If we want to win, we must take risks and strive towards our goal. The other option was very simple: not get involved, distance ourselves from the whole idea, but as our organisers and friends in the international affairs and sports worlds all said, our bid would have been almost sure to lose then. The people at the top should always be personally involved. We did this and we achieved our goal, and this makes me very happy. Andrei Malakhov: Some people say that the Soccer World Cup is a celebration of sports. Others say it is an event for the sake of international prestige, and yet others call it the kind of grand national construction project the Soviet leaders liked to get the country building. So, what is it above all in your eyes: grand national project, boost to international prestige, or celebration of sport? Vladimir Putin: The top priority is what we talked about at the beginning — getting young people into sport. The idea of a big national construction project is a secondary consideration. And of course it won’t be of the Soviet-era kind, though it certainly will be a big project. In this sense, even with the global economy going through a lot of turbulence, as the trendy term goes, projects such as holding the Olympics, the APEC summit in Vladivostok, or the World University Games in Kazan all help to boost economic growth. The Soccer World Cup project will see state, regional and local authorities investing in a very important sphere, namely, the country’s health. It will create new jobs and bring new technology, and it will develop infrastructure, not just sports infrastructure, but engineering and transport infrastructure too. It will leave people with something that will serve them for decades to come. As I said – and this is a very important point – it will be an engine for growth in the construction sector, and each new job in the construction sector could create a dozen jobs in related sectors too. In short, this is an important project in every respect.  Andrei Malakhov: In two hours’ time, some will be overjoyed and others will be disappointed, because the initial idea was that 15 cities in Russia would host World Cup matches, then it was 13, and now it is 11. How will you support those who won’t hear their favourite city’s name when the envelopes are opened? Vladimir Putin: According to the FIFA rules, or rather traditions, competition takes place in approximately ten cities. We put forward 15 at first, and then 13, so that the FIFA delegation, the FIFA commission, could visit all of the proposed host venues and choose the ones that best meet FIFA’s requirements. It is the FIFA commission that will make the final decision. We currently have 13 cities on the list. This will go down to 10 or 11. We will fight to have 11 host cities. But no one will be left out in this celebration of life and sport. We will try to organise everything in such a way that if cities are struck off the list, and unfortunately this will happen, they will get to host training and rest bases for the different teams, so that the people taking part in the World Cup will still come to their cities. If needed, we are ready to subsidise intercity travel so that people can get to the competition venues at cheaper cost. This goes for rail and road transport, and for other kinds of transport if need be, including planes. If required, we will subsidise these measures. I am sure that the entire country, all sports lovers in any case, will be happy. I too am looking forward to this celebration. Andrei Malakhov: Do you also not know which cities will win? Vladimir Putin: No, I don’t know the winners. It is my big hope that as well as promoting sport in general among the public, this competition will also give a boost to top-level sport, soccer in this particular case, and that our top teams and players will get themselves up to world standards and put on a performance worthy of our country.  Andrei Malakhov: Well, their pay, in some cases at least, is certainly at international level, so now it just remains to get their game up to par too. Vladimir Putin: I hope very much that this will happen. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16551, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Comments on Russia’s preparations for the 2018 Soccer World Cup', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin answered Channel One Russia anchor Andrei Malakhov’s questions on Russia’s preparations for the 2018 Soccer World Cup.', 'tags': ['Sport'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Above all, it is an excellent opportunity for us to get a lot more young people interested in sport, get them hooked on sport rather than on drink and cigarettes. We have been putting much more attention into sports programmes of late, and this is a justified policy given the demographic problems we face and the need to improve our people’s health. These kinds of big competitions offer a real chance to get young people involved in sport. We started this whole process quite a long time ago. We began setting our sights on it back in 2005. It was then that we had our first discussions on the matter with the FIFA officials, with [FIFA President] Joseph Blatter and other sports organisers at the international level. In 2008, we started actually carrying out our plans and made our bid, and in 2010 we were named as the host country. Of course, if you get involved in particular programmes and projects you always put your reputation on the line in the sense that things might not work out for reasons beyond your control, and I was fully aware of this aspect of course, fully aware of the possible risks. But at the same time, I have always believed – and practice supports me here – that it is right to take these risks, because the minute the issue of reputation starts taking precedence in the minds of people doing jobs such as mine, actual substance and action start taking second place and then we all end up losing out for sure. And so, while I was aware of the risks, there was no doubt in my mind that giving this bid our clear support was the right thing to do. If we want to win, we must take risks and strive towards our goal. The other option was very simple: not get involved, distance ourselves from the whole idea, but as our organisers and friends in the international affairs and sports worlds all said, our bid would have been almost sure to lose then. The people at the top should always be personally involved. We did this and we achieved our goal, and this makes me very happy. The top priority is what we talked about at the beginning — getting young people into sport. The idea of a big national construction project is a secondary consideration. And of course it won’t be of the Soviet-era kind, though it certainly will be a big project. In this sense, even with the global economy going through a lot of turbulence, as the trendy term goes, projects such as holding the Olympics, the APEC summit in Vladivostok, or the World University Games in Kazan all help to boost economic growth. The Soccer World Cup project will see state, regional and local authorities investing in a very important sphere, namely, the country’s health. It will create new jobs and bring new technology, and it will develop infrastructure, not just sports infrastructure, but engineering and transport infrastructure too. It will leave people with something that will serve them for decades to come. As I said – and this is a very important point – it will be an engine for growth in the construction sector, and each new job in the construction sector could create a dozen jobs in related sectors too. In short, this is an important project in every respect.  According to the FIFA rules, or rather traditions, competition takes place in approximately ten cities. We put forward 15 at first, and then 13, so that the FIFA delegation, the FIFA commission, could visit all of the proposed host venues and choose the ones that best meet FIFA’s requirements. It is the FIFA commission that will make the final decision. We currently have 13 cities on the list. This will go down to 10 or 11. We will fight to have 11 host cities. But no one will be left out in this celebration of life and sport. We will try to organise everything in such a way that if cities are struck off the list, and unfortunately this will happen, they will get to host training and rest bases for the different teams, so that the people taking part in the World Cup will still come to their cities. If needed, we are ready to subsidise intercity travel so that people can get to the competition venues at cheaper cost. This goes for rail and road transport, and for other kinds of transport if need be, including planes. If required, we will subsidise these measures. I am sure that the entire country, all sports lovers in any case, will be happy. I too am looking forward to this celebration. No, I don’t know the winners. It is my big hope that as well as promoting sport in general among the public, this competition will also give a boost to top-level sport, soccer in this particular case, and that our top teams and players will get themselves up to world standards and put on a performance worthy of our country. I hope very much that this will happen. <…>', 'wordlist': ['above', 'all', ',', 'it', 'be', 'an', 'excellent', 'opportunity', 'for', 'we', 'to', 'get', 'a', 'lot', 'more', 'young', 'people',

            "{'date': '2012-10-01T14:30:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': 'Subjects discussed at the meeting included national social policy priorities, pension system development, improving senior citizens’ quality of life, healthcare services, recreation and leisure opportunities, and giving them a bigger place in society. Taking part in the meeting were Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets     Golodets Olga , Labour and Social Protection Minister Maxim Topilin, Healthcare Minister Veronika Skvortsova, Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin     Sobyanin SergeiMoscow Mayor , Presidential Aide Elvira Nabiullina     Nabiullina ElviraGovernor of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia) , Chairman of the Social Policy Committee of the Council of Federation and President of the Union of Pensioners Valery Ryazansky, and representatives of public charity and volunteer groups and organisations. * * * Speech at meeting with veterans and public organisations representatives President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends. Here today are officials from the federal agencies and Moscow City government, and representatives of public and veterans’ organisations. Our meeting is taking place on Senior Citizens’ Day. This day, not just in Russia, but all around the world, has come to symbolise the particular attention society pays to senior citizens’ issues and the responsibility we all have towards our parents and those who have devoted their lives to their country, people, children, and society. Seeing as this meeting is taking place on Senior Citizens’ Day, it should focus on senior citizens’ issues, all the more so as we have people professionally involved in precisely this area present, and I will therefore start by giving a few statistics. I am sure that many of you are familiar with them already, but these are nonetheless some of the latest figures and give quite an accurate picture.  Russia had a total of 40.2 million pensioners as at January 1, 2012, of which 33 percent had retired because they had reached retirement age. This puts almost one in five people in the Russian Federation above the retirement age. One in five people.  National average life expectancy came to 70.3 years in 2011 – an increase of 3.7 years compared to 2006. This is quite good progress overall. The life expectancy figure for men is still quite low at 64.3 years, but at the same time, there has been an of almost 4 years’ increase compared to 2006. Average life expectancy for women is 76.1 years, which is an increase of almost three years compared to the 2006 figure. Our target is to achieve average life expectancy of at least 74 years by 2018, with an average figure of 68.9 years for men and 79.6 years for women. The overall share of senior citizens in the population will continue to grow steadily.  Ensuring decent conditions for senior citizens’ life is a big task involving many different aspects, and we can resolve it only if the authorities, business, NGOs, volunteers and religious organisations all join forces and make a common effort. Not only is this work hugely important for millions of people in Russia, but it has a particular moral dimension too. The life of our senior citizens, their quality of life, is the measure by which we judge the government’s effectiveness and the moral state of our society. The authorities have direct responsibility for establishing a sustainable and balanced pension system that takes into account citizens’ labour contributions and makes it possible to pay decent pensions. The Russian authorities have never shirked this responsibility. Even during the crisis, when the economy and the macroeconomic situation were experiencing great difficulties, we increased pensions substantially. Now the Government has drafted a pension system development strategy through to 2030. I was told that the draft has just been submitted to the Presidential Executive Office. I think the Government should definitely organise the broadest possible discussion on this matter given its key social and economic importance. I know that the Labour and Social Protection Ministry published the document on its website recently, but there was not enough time for the expert community, public organisations, and the Public Council to study it properly. It takes time to get fully immersed in the subject. Of course, I too will make a thorough study of the strategy’s proposals. I ask the Government to go back and organise the broadest possible discussion, this time not just with the Labour and Social Protection Ministry’s officials, but with the Government Cabinet, above all the deputy prime ministers responsible for social issues and for the economy too. Working from this Government base the Open Government system should also be brought into play here and become a tool we can use to properly analyse and discuss this issue from all the different angles.  One thing I particularly stress is that we must preserve what we have already achieved so far and ensure long-term development of a pensions system that is fair, just, and reliable. Of course, senior citizens’ quality of life cannot be measured by the size of their pensions alone. We also should give senior citizens a genuinely comfortable environment in general. People who want to work and play an active part in social and cultural life should have the chance to do so. We are to give people opportunities for self-realisation. At the same time, we also have to ensure full and real care for those no longer able to take care of their own needs. State social spending has increased 2.5-fold over recent years. We are not talking about mere percentage points here but about a much more substantial increase. At the same time however, we do recognise that most people have yet to see real evidence of an improvement in social services. We are spending ever more money but still not getting the quality we want. We have to see a return on each ruble invested, and to achieve this will require making a transition from estimate-based funding to payment for actual services provided. This has proven an effective policy in practically all social areas. [Mayor of Moscow] Mr Sobyanin applied this approach during his time in Tyumen, when he was governor there, and in the government, and now is carrying out these policies in Moscow, and quite effectively too, I think.  Let me say, too, that social sector workers’ pay does not match the stress and intensity of their work. In the executive orders I issued in May, I set the objective of bringing social sector employees’ pay up to the regional average wage by 2018. To be honest, it makes me ashamed to speak of it. We made the decision recently to raise wages in the culture sector by an average of 30–33 percent. These wage rises do not apply to every person in the sector. As for the social sector, wages in this sector are only 35.5 percent of the average national wage. This is a disgrace, really, and I draw the regional governors’ attention to this issue. The objectives I stated in the May executive orders must be reached by 2018, and this means taking the required steps and measures, starting from next year. In other words, this means really raising the wages of the people working in this very important sector. This is not just about our attitude towards social sector workers, after all, but about how we treat our older people. There are public and religious organisations, volunteers and philanthropists who selflessly help senior citizens and do so very professionally and – most important – in all sincerity.  The local and regional authorities should work more actively together with social sector NGOs and cast aside the various stereotypes and prejudices that still exist in this respect. We are to make public-private partnerships a key instrument of social policy. Certainly, we also have to give public-private partnerships in the social sector a clear legislative framework. The mechanisms should be clearly set out above all in the law on basic social provision for the population that the Labour and Social Protection Ministry is currently drafting. Mr Topilin, what stage are you at in this work? Labour and Social Protection Minister Maxim Topilin: We have gone through several approvals stages among the various ministries and discussed the document through the open government framework on the ministry’s website. Now, acting on [Deputy Prime Minister] Ms Golodets’ instruction, we are going through the draft with Civic Chamber members. I will not hide that we still have a number of issues to settle with the Economy and Finance Ministries, but I think we will be able to find solutions here. If the Civic Chamber gives us its proposed amendments soon I think we will be able to rework the draft and have it ready by the end of the year, and then there will be the legal experts, the Presidential Executive Office, and the other procedures. Overall, I think the document is quite close to being ready. Our colleagues from the Civic Chamber should be able to help us here and set out their thoughts on what we should change and adjust.  Vladimir Putin: Just as with the pension system development strategy, you are to organise broad public discussion. Maxim Topilin: Yes, this is just what we are doing. We have discussed the document in the State Duma and the Council of Federation. CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CIVIC CHAMBER COMMISSION ON SOCIAL POLICY, LABOUR RELATIONS, AND PEOPLE’S QUALITY OF LIFE YELENA TOPOLEVA-SOLDUNOVA: Mr President, I am the chairperson of the Civic Chamber’s social policy commission. We are about to send our proposed amendments to the law this evening as it happens. Most of our proposals are about what you just talked about: the need for competition in the social services sector and separating the functions of those contracting and providing the social services, so as to give NGOs and private business the chance to compete too. We think that the more competition, the more effective service provision will be.  Vladimir Putin: Absolutely, and I was going to make precisely this point. We have to ensure that NGOs and organisations of all legal forms should be able to compete to receive state and regional funds. Yelena Topoleva-Soldunova: Yes, this is absolutely right. In some regions this system is also working and producing very good results. The main thing now is to make sure we spread this best practice. In St Petersburg, for example, we have a school for foster parents, and non-commercial organisations bid on an exclusively competitive basis to organise these courses. This kind of approach is working well in Tyumen, Perm, and Moscow, but unfortunately, it is still a long way from being applied everywhere yet.  We cannot dictate to the regions what they should do. The Constitution does not allow us to set such binding instructions, but with the help of this law we can at least try to set the direction so as to spread examples of best practice throughout the whole country. We have to make the amendments to the law that will enable it to work this way. Vladimir Putin: Good. Another problem I want to draw to your attention is that of using charity funds. Let me make it clear that we have no restrictions on using charity organisations’ funds and aid, including from abroad. Indeed, this is only welcomed. If private individuals and organisations want to help pensioners, children, people with disabilities, let me say again that we will only welcome and support this. For our part, we are increasing the support fund for NGOs, including Russian organisations with a social-sector focus. As you have no doubt heard, we plan to allocate up to 3 billion rubles [$100 million] from the federal budget for these organisations’ work. The overall logic is that NGOs or private organisations should have the chance to provide social services on an equal footing with the state-provided services, as Ms Topoleva-Soldunova was saying just now. I hope that the quality of social services will increase at the same time. We will have to draft criteria for evaluating organisations’ performance in this area. We should have an independent evaluation system ready and in place by April 1, 2013. This system will cover criteria for evaluating organisations’ effectiveness in the social sector, and a system of public ratings of their performance.  Let me say a few words now about the specific areas of our work together. I will begin with provision of help to senior citizens who, for reasons of age and health, require special care. This is above all the case of people living on their own. We have a network of homes for the elderly, around 4,000 of them, 99 percent of which are run by the regional authorities, with the remaining slightly more than one percent in private hands. Unfortunately, many of these establishments are in not as good a state as this one that we are visiting today. This building was built in 1975, but the city authorities look after it well. Mr Sobyanin has even promised additional repairs to the façade. Sergei Sobyanin: This is the last stage. Vladimir Putin: Just don’t say it’s the last of the money too. Sergei Sobyanin: No, it’s not the last of the money. Vladimir Putin: Overall around the country – as I discussed just before with veterans’ council – there are more than 600 buildings that are all but unfit for use now and in urgent need of total renovation. I hope the regional authorities will come up with the additional funding to ensure that our senior citizens live in decent and civilized conditions. For our part, aside from the funds already earmarked in the budget, we will put an additional 350 million rubles from the Presidential Reserve Fund into supporting social institutions. This comes to half of the fund’s annual spending. I ask the Labour and Social Protection Ministry to draft proposals on specific establishments, and the Presidential Executive Office to draft the relevant instruction. Overall, we also should change the mechanisms and substantially improve the technical equipment of the social establishments for senior citizens. They must meet modern standards and be accessible, including for people with health problems and disabilities.  Of course, the state will retain the key responsibility for ensuring the conditions for senior citizens in these establishments, but NGOs can help in organising cultural programmes, repairs, and purchasing equipment. Projects of this kind are already underway. Most senior citizens, however, prefer to remain in their familiar home environment. They should be able to receive all the necessary social services at home. We need to make a thorough study of Russia’s own experience and world practice and draw on the best examples of patron services and the most advanced individual care methods and technology. This is an area where effective cooperation between the state authorities and NGOs is particularly important. Another matter is that we are to pay serious attention to improving medical services for senior citizens, not just in specialised centres but also in ordinary medical centres and at home, as I said. People should not have to wait in lines, but we know that this problem still persists in many places. Constant effort is required too, to improve provision of medicines and so on. Organising senior citizens’ leisure and getting them more involved in public life are very important areas of NGOs’ work in the social sector. I think the regional and local authorities should give these organisations and volunteers all necessary organisational and other support. Protecting senior citizens’ social and economic rights is a meticulous task that must continue every single day. Very often it happens that senior citizens need to obtain information on all manner of different social protection issues, and of course it is hard for them to go into battle against housing organisations or officials who do not do their jobs properly and procrastinate with decisions or even try to shrug off responsibility for senior citizens’ problems altogether.  I think that NGOs and public organisations should be active and energetic here and defend senior citizens’ interests and rights using all lawful means available. I know that the people here today are all actively involved in this area of such importance for the country. So, let’s discuss all the issues that I mentioned, as well as any other issues you want to raise at this meeting. * * * Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, in conclusion, I would like to say the following. The traditions of nearly all the peoples of the Russian Federation, including ethnic Russians, other bigger peoples, and minority groups, have always included a special respect for the elderly, and there is great national wisdom in that. Under modern conditions, on account of urbanisation and the decay or erosion of certain traditional values, we often witness careless attitudes toward the elderly. But this represents a mine that could one day detonate all the foundations of our society. Why do the traditions of all the peoples of the Russian Federation, as well as the former Soviet Union, include particular respect for the elderly generation? Because they are the bearers of our traditions and culture – and I mean culture in the broadest sense of the word, the moral origins that lie at the foundation of any society. If it is eroded, then society itself begins to unravel. So we do not have the right to treat members of the elder generation as obsolescent. Maintaining a caring attitude toward the elderly is a truly important social, humanitarian and governmental objective. Of course, in recent years we have made some progress in this respect. I am referring to increasing pensions and providing housing to veterans, although this task is not yet finished, but it is progressing and will certainly be addressed the same way as the problem of medicines. Just to mention, recently we lived in a time when we spoke about the need for medicines provision in general and at reduced price, but there weren’t any discounted pharmaceuticals at all since there were no government funding for their supply. Now, the situation is changing, even though we are facing many problems in this area. Some Russian federal constituent entities that are giving these matters very careful attention, include Belgorod, Moscow, Samara, Magnitogorsk and many other regions. But ultimately, there are many places that still have quite a few problems. I must say that it’s not just in rural areas, but in major urban centres as well, including cities with populations of over one million. Our country has many problems overall in providing dignified standards and quality of life for the elderly. I want to thank everyone present at today’s vent, and not just you personally, but everyone who is working with you and all members of public associations – first and foremost, I want to thank them for the work they are doing and call on government agencies to face all these problems head-on. I have arranged with [Healthcare Minister] Ms Skvortsova to receive corresponding information on all the issues raised here today, by December. But I will ask Minister Topilin to analyse everything that is happening in this area, in order for today’s meeting to be more than a conversation on an important given topic, but also a trigger for us to delve deeper into all these problems, to understand what is happening in this area, to identify the weakest links and sore spots. And I will ask you to make suggestions regarding this – the approaches and pace we are to move forward, in order to make the lives of the elderly more dignified. Thank you very much and goodbye.', 'kremlin_id': 16556, 'place': 'Moscow', 'title': 'Vladimir Putin met with veterans on Senior Citizens’ Day', 'teaser': 'The President visited a Moscow labour veterans’ rest home, where he met with veterans and public organisations representatives.', 'tags': ['Pensions', 'Social services'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, friends. Here today are officials from the federal agencies and Moscow City government, and representatives of public and veterans’ organisations. Our meeting is taking place on Senior Citizens’ Day. This day, not just in Russia, but all around the world, has come to symbolise the particular attention society pays to senior citizens’ issues and the responsibility we all have towards our parents and those who have devoted their lives to their country, people, children, and society. Seeing as this meeting is taking place on Senior Citizens’ Day, it should focus on senior citizens’ issues, all the more so as we have people professionally involved in precisely this area present, and I will therefore start by giving a few statistics. I am sure that many of you are familiar with them already, but these are nonetheless some of the latest figures and give quite an accurate picture.  Russia had a total of 40.2 million pensioners as at January 1, 2012, of which 33 percent had retired because they had reached retirement age. This puts almost one in five people in the Russian Federation above the retirement age. One in five people.  National average life expectancy came to 70.3 years in 2011 – an increase of 3.7 years compared to 2006. This is quite good progress overall. The life expectancy figure for men is still quite low at 64.3 years, but at the same time, there has been an of almost 4 years’ increase compared to 2006. Average life expectancy for women is 76.1 years, which is an increase of almost three years compared to the 2006 figure. Our target is to achieve average life expectancy of at least 74 years by 2018, with an average figure of 68.9 years for men and 79.6 years for women. The overall share of senior citizens in the population will continue to grow steadily.  Ensuring decent conditions for senior citizens’ life is a big task involving many different aspects, and we can resolve it only if the authorities, business, NGOs, volunteers and religious organisations all join forces and make a common effort. Not only is this work hugely important for millions of people in Russia, but it has a particular moral dimension too. The life of our senior citizens, their quality of life, is the measure by which we judge the government’s effectiveness and the moral state of our society. The authorities have direct responsibility for establishing a sustainable and balanced pension system that takes into account citizens’ labour contributions and makes it possible to pay decent pensions. The Russian authorities have never shirked this responsibility. Even during the crisis, when the economy and the macroeconomic situation were experiencing great difficulties, we increased pensions substantially. Now the Government has drafted a pension system development strategy through to 2030. I was told that the draft has just been submitted to the Presidential Executive Office. I think the Government should definitely organise the broadest possible discussion on this matter given its key social and economic importance. I know that the Labour and Social Protection Ministry published the document on its website recently, but there was not enough time for the expert community, public organisations, and the Public Council to study it properly. It takes time to get fully immersed in the subject. Of course, I too will make a thorough study of the strategy’s proposals. I ask the Government to go back and organise the broadest possible discussion, this time not just with the Labour and Social Protection Ministry’s officials, but with the Government Cabinet, above all the deputy prime ministers responsible for social issues and for the economy too. Working from this Government base the Open Government system should also be brought into play here and become a tool we can use to properly analyse and discuss this issue from all the different angles.  One thing I particularly stress is that we must preserve what we have already achieved so far and ensure long-term development of a pensions system that is fair, just, and reliable. Of course, senior citizens’ quality of life cannot be measured by the size of their pensions alone. We also should give senior citizens a genuinely comfortable environment in general. People who want to work and play an active part in social and cultural life should have the chance to do so. We are to give people opportunities for self-realisation. At the same time, we also have to ensure full and real care for those no longer able to take care of their own needs. State social spending has increased 2.5-fold over recent years. We are not talking about mere percentage points here but about a much more substantial increase. At the same time however, we do recognise that most people have yet to see real evidence of an improvement in social services. We are spending ever more money but still not getting the quality we want. We have to see a return on each ruble invested, and to achieve this will require making a transition from estimate-based funding to payment for actual services provided. This has proven an effective policy in practically all social areas. [Mayor of Moscow] Mr Sobyanin applied this approach during his time in Tyumen, when he was governor there, and in the government, and now is carrying out these policies in Moscow, and quite effectively too, I think.  Let me say, too, that social sector workers’ pay does not match the stress and intensity of their work. In the executive orders I issued in May, I set the objective of bringing social sector employees’ pay up to the regional average wage by 2018. To be honest, it makes me ashamed to speak of it. We made the decision recently to raise wages in the culture sector by an average of 30–33 percent. These wage rises do not apply to every person in the sector. As for the social sector, wages in this sector are only 35.5 percent of the average national wage. This is a disgrace, really, and I draw the regional governors’ attention to this issue. The objectives I stated in the May executive orders must be reached by 2018, and this means taking the required steps and measures, starting from next year. In other words, this means really raising the wages of the people working in this very important sector. This is not just about our attitude towards social sector workers, after all, but about how we treat our older people. There are public and religious organisations, volunteers and philanthropists who selflessly help senior citizens and do so very professionally and – most important – in all sincerity.  The local and regional authorities should work more actively together with social sector NGOs and cast aside the various stereotypes and prejudices that still exist in this respect. We are to make public-private partnerships a key instrument of social policy. Certainly, we also have to give public-private partnerships in the social sector a clear legislative framework. The mechanisms should be clearly set out above all in the law on basic social provision for the population that the Labour and Social Protection Ministry is currently drafting. Mr Topilin, what stage are you at in this work? Just as with the pension system development strategy, you are to organise broad public discussion. Absolutely, and I was going to make precisely this point. We have to ensure that NGOs and organisations of all legal forms should be able to compete to receive state and regional funds. Good. Another problem I want to draw to your attention is that of using charity funds. Let me make it clear that we have no restrictions on using charity organisations’ funds and aid, including from abroad. Indeed, this is only welcomed. If private individuals and organisations want to help pensioners, children, people with disabilities, let me say again that we will only welcome and support this. For our part, we are increasing the support fund for NGOs, including Russian organisations with a social-sector focus. As you have no doubt heard, we plan to allocate up to 3 billion rubles [$100 million] from the federal budget for these organisations’ work. The overall logic is that NGOs or private organisations should have the chance to provide social services on an equal footing with the state-provided services, as Ms Topoleva-Soldunova was saying just now. I hope that the quality of social services will increase at the same time. We will have to draft criteria for evaluating organisations’ performance in this area. We should have an independent evaluation system ready and in place by April 1, 2013. This system will cover criteria for evaluating organisations’ effectiveness in the social sector, and a system of public ratings of their performance.  Let me say a few words now about the specific areas of our work together. I will begin with provision of help to senior citizens who, for reasons of age and health, require special care. This is above all the case of people living on their own. We have a network of homes for the elderly, around 4,000 of them, 99 percent of which are run by the regional authorities, with the remaining slightly more than one percent in private hands. Unfortunately, many of these establishments are in not as good a state as this one that we are visiting today. This building was built in 1975, but the city authorities look after it well. Mr Sobyanin has even promised additional repairs to the façade. Just don’t say it’s the last of the money too. Overall around the country – as I discussed just before with veterans’ council – there are more than 600 buildings that are all but unfit for use now and in urgent need of total renovation. I hope the regional authorities will come up with the additional funding to ensure that our senior citizens live in decent and civilized conditions. For our part, aside from the funds already earmarked in the budget, we will put an additional 350 million rubles from the Presidential Reserve Fund into supporting social institutions. This comes to half of the fund’s annual spending. I ask the Labour and Social Protection Ministry to draft proposals on specific establishments, and the Presidential Executive Office to draft the relevant instruction. Overall, we also should change the mechanisms and substantially improve the technical equipment of the social establishments for senior citizens. They must meet modern standards and be accessible, including for people with health problems and disabilities.  Of course, the state will retain the key responsibility for ensuring the conditions for senior citizens in these establishments, but NGOs can help in organising cultural programmes, repairs, and purchasing equipment. Projects of this kind are already underway. Most senior citizens, however, prefer to remain in their familiar home environment. They should be able to receive all the necessary social services at home. We need to make a thorough study of Russia’s own experience and world practice and draw on the best examples of patron services and the most advanced individual care methods and technology. This is an area where effective cooperation between the state authorities and NGOs is particularly important. Another matter is that we are to pay serious attention to improving medical services for senior citizens, not just in specialised centres but also in ordinary medical centres and at home, as I said. People should not have to wait in lines, but we know that this problem still persists in many places. Constant effort is required too, to improve provision of medicines and so on. Organising senior citizens’ leisure and getting them more involved in public life are very important areas of NGOs’ work in the social sector. I think the regional and local authorities should give these organisations and volunteers all necessary organisational and other support. Protecting senior citizens’ social and economic rights is a meticulous task that must continue every single day. Very often it happens that senior citizens need to obtain information on all manner of different social protection issues, and of course it is hard for them to go into battle against housing organisations or officials who do not do their jobs properly and procrastinate with decisions or even try to shrug off responsibility for senior citizens’ problems altogether.  I think that NGOs and public organisations should be active and energetic here and defend senior citizens’ interests and rights using all lawful means available. I know that the people here today are all actively involved in this area of such importance for the country. So, let’s discuss all the issues that I mentioned, as well as any other issues you want to raise at this meeting. * * * Colleagues, in conclusion, I would like to say the following. The traditions of nearly all the peoples of the Russian Federation, including ethnic Russians, other bigger peoples, and minority groups, have always included a special respect for the elderly, and there is great national wisdom in that. Under modern conditions, on account of urbanisation and the decay or erosion of certain traditional values, we often witness careless attitudes toward the elderly. But this represents a mine that could one day detonate all the foundations of our society. Why do the traditions of all the peoples of the Russian Federation, as well as the former Soviet Union, include particular respect for the elderly generation? Because they are the bearers of our traditions and culture – and I mean culture in the broadest sense of the word, the moral origins that lie at the foundation of any society. If it is eroded, then society itself begins to unravel. So we do not have the right to treat members of the elder generation as obsolescent. Maintaining a caring attitude toward the elderly is a truly important social, humanitarian and governmental objective. Of course, in recent years we have made some progress in this respect. I am referring to increasing pensions and providing housing to veterans, although this task is not yet finished, but it is progressing and will certainly be addressed the same way as the problem of medicines. Just to mention, recently we lived in a time when we spoke about the need for medicines provision in general and at reduced price, but there weren’t any discounted pharmaceuticals at all since there were no government funding for their supply. Now, the situation is changing, even though we are facing many problems in this area. Some Russian federal constituent entities that are giving these matters very careful attention, include Belgorod, Moscow, Samara, Magnitogorsk and many other regions. But ultimately, there are many places that still have quite a few problems. I must say that it’s not just in rural areas, but in major urban centres as well, including cities with populations of over one million. Our country has many problems overall in providing dignified standards and quality of life for the elderly. I want to thank everyone present at today’s vent, and not just you personally, but everyone who is working with you and all members of public associations – first and foremost, I want to thank them for the work they are doing and call on government agencies to face all these problems head-on. I have arranged with [Healthcare Minister] Ms Skvortsova to receive corresponding information on all the issues raised here today, by December.

And I will ask you to make suggestions regarding this – the approaches and pace we are to move forward, in order to make the lives of the elderly more dignified.

Among the main topics for discussion are the strategic priorities of the country’s development in terms of changes in global economic markets, the creation of the Common Economic Space   Background information Common Economic Space (CES)    and Russia's accession to the WTO. The RUSSIA CALLING! Forum has been held annually since 2009 and aims to develop an effective dialogue between the Russian business community and international investors, as well as to attract foreign investment in the Russian economy. * * * Excerpts from transcript of the RUSSIA CALLING! Investment Forum plenary session  President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to welcome once again to Moscow representatives of major companies, business leaders and investors. Despite its youth, the forum organised on the initiative of VTB Bank has become a significant event in the economic life of our country and in the international calendar of such events. It serves as a useful platform for open discussions on complex economic issues and elaborating new approaches to the investment policy. The name of the RUSSIA CALLING! forum reflects the nature of our policy of openness and partnership. Our goal is to maximise the profitability of investing in Russia, working in Russia, creating new jobs and setting up production here. We see this as a real indicator of our country’s competitiveness and the efficiency of all major state and economic institutions. The main question is what to do first to transform Russia into a centre of attraction for foreign and not only foreign but first and foremost our own domestic investments and capital, to make sure it obtains the necessary resources for modernisation and further economic growth. Today, Russia has an impressive potential for sustainable development. It is among the world leaders in terms of key macroeconomic stability indicators. National debt, as you know, is only about 10% of GDP, and the debt to foreign investors, our lenders is only 2.5%. Foreign currency reserves at the end of September reached $522 billion. Inflation fell below 7%; we repeatedly cited these figure: 6.1% last year, the lowest inflation rate in 20 years. We expect it to fall to below 5% by 2014. Keeping inflation down remains one of our top priorities. We did not restrict the freedom of capital flow even during the global economic crisis, although the temptation was there and experts suggested this course of action. We could have introduced such restrictions to protect our interests, but we chose not to do so because we believed that tactical losses could become strategic, and it is better to wait it out, to gather strength and hold out in this difficult situation. Investment inflows in the period from 2009 to 2011 amounted to 3% of GDP. This is above the average global level. In comparison, this figure in European countries, Brazil, China and India did not exceed 2% of GDP in the same period. Moreover, the main sources of investment in Russia were Germany, France, Sweden and the Netherlands, in addition to the traditional offshore zones. We realise that investment from the Netherlands and Cyprus is the repatriation of Russian capital, but that is good as well. Today, despite the slowdown in almost all neighbouring regions, our economy continues to grow. According to the Economic Development Ministry, GDP grew by 4% in the first eight months of 2012, and experts believe that this trend will continue on average over the next three years. Although lower than before the crisis, this growth is much more balanced and higher quality. Actually, just the fact that there is any growth at all is a positive development because we don’t see it much in the current global economic climate. I want to emphasise that this growth is not based on a steady increase in oil prices or amassing foreign debt by banks and companies. That is, this growth is not based on oil revenues and debt bubbles. Naturally, I will admit that the commodity market has been doing well and that has had a positive impact on our economy, but it has not been booming either. However, we also take into account the serious risks associated with the uncertain situation on foreign markets. We cannot but be concerned by the clear signs of recession in some European countries – and the European Union, as you know, is our largest trade and economic partner: more than 50% of Russia’s trade is with EU countries. Industrial production and GDP have slowed down in China and social tension is growing in a number of countries, which is a negative phenomenon in itself but it also has a harmful effect on the economy. We certainly hope that the measures taken by our partners will improve the situation. For our part, however, will be do our utmost to protect our interests against any negative developments in the European and in the global economy. Thus, in drafting the budget for 2013–2015, we implemented the budget rule for the first time. We began to work on it two years ago and discussed it at length. In fact, the main parameters of this rule were worked out by the end of 2011, and now the Government has finalised and adopted it. The budget rule logic is based on the premise that the dependence of the Russian budget on oil prices must decrease. This will be a stable long-term trend. Over the next three years, the deficit of non-oil and gas revenues will fall from 10.5% of GDP in 2012 to 8.5% in 2015. I must say that the budget rule is a necessity for us because the revenues from the oil and gas sector will inevitably decline and our fiscal policy cannot ignore this. In case of a severe change in the global economy in 2013, the budget provides for anti-crisis measures, including redistribution mechanisms for budgetary allocations, for example, the option to invest up to 150 billion rubles [$5 billion] in the recapitalisation of the banking sector should there be a crisis. We don’t expect it to happen but, if required, this can be done through the exchange of federal bonds for bank securities. In addition, in some important and strategic industries companies can be granted further state guarantees. Together, these measures will help stabilise the economy in almost any scenario. However, we see the main guarantee of stability in the policy aimed at supporting growth and promoting business, trade and investment. In this regard, I would like to mention the landmark event of the year: Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation. For us, participation in this organisation is a key foreign economic priority. We hope that this step will have a positive effect on the investors’ attitude and will pave the way for promising long-term projects. We have always believed that accession to the WTO will make our economy and the rules by which it operates more transparent and understandable to investors from any country around the world that is a member of this organisation. In the coming years, we intend to join the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Ladies and gentlemen, Today the positive dynamic of the Russian economy, the accumulated safety factors and our reserves allow us to set new ambitious goals. At the same time, we realise that there are no simple solutions or easy growth opportunities. Just three or four years ago, the world believed that global problems could be quickly resolved. Now everyone has realised that we need time and unconventional approaches to overcome the challenges we face. We must substantially alter the basic economic development model in order to recover from the current crisis. Such changes will affect virtually all economies in the world, and attempts to cling to the old formulas will only preserve the problems. We must stimulate structural change, create the conditions for the emergence of new economic sectors and look for modern sources of growth. We are aware that this requirement has a direct impact on our economic policy. Against the background of global change, including in the energy sector, we have to radically accelerate the diversification of the national economy and technological innovation, which is extremely important. We must move to a new technological structure. The potential of growth through the exploitation of long-existing capacities has been practically exhausted. This is evidenced by a low unemployment rate compared to the level of the past 20 years. We certainly believe that this is an economic and social achievement but it also shows us that growth based on the old production capacities is no longer possible. We have a 5.1% unemployment rate – one of the lowest in Europe and in the world. Further growth is possible only through investment in new manufacturing facilities and upgrading the existing ones, as well as investment in human resources development. We aim to create or update at least 25 million jobs by 2020. By the way, this is an initiative introduced by one of the business associations, and I think it is absolutely correct. At first glance, it seems very difficult, perhaps even impossible, but our experts have made calculations along with this association and have concluded that it is possible. I do not mean the creation of entirely new jobs but rather upgrading and restructuring the jobs that already exist. All of this can lead to 25 million high-level and well-paid jobs. By 2018, we aim to increase work productivity by 1.5 times compared with 2011 and the share of high-tech and knowledge-intensive industries in the GDP by 1.3 times. By 2015, investment is expected to grow to at least 25% of GDP, and to 27% by 2018. We have already launched active efforts to achieve the stated objectives. Thus, we are developing roadmaps together with the business community for specific areas of improving the business climate and we will monitor their implementation together with the business community. The Russian regions will play a central role in improving the business climate and attracting investors. Before the crisis, a healthy competition emerged among our regions in a bid to attract investment. The leading regions were able to dramatically change the structure of their economy. Last year, the Agency for Strategic Initiatives launched an important pilot project with the participation of the business community: the introduction of a regional government standard for improving the investment climate. Best practices of cooperation with investors should become the norm for all regional administrations. We invite investors to cooperate actively with the regions and with the Agency for Strategic Initiatives, and to determine together the best approaches to the improvement of the business environment. I will reiterate: Russia is open to foreign direct investment and domestic investment in industry, services, agriculture and the innovation sector. We hope that capital will be followed by technology, management experience and modern models of production, distribution and service networks, which our foreign partners have. Domestic financial market infrastructure development is a major priority for us. This means enhancing its stability, establishing an international financial centre in Moscow and developing modern investment instruments. All this will allow our companies to quickly and easily raise capital from domestic and foreign sources. The Central Depository will begin to operate by November. Its goal is to help foreign investors enter the Russian financial market, to make the system of securities title recording more transparent and understandable. With the adoption of the laws On Clearing and Clearing Activities and On Organised Trading we have created the necessary legal conditions for the development of financial market infrastructure entities: exchanges and the central counterparty. They will operate in accordance with international standards, significantly reducing the risk for market participants. Our agenda includes the cancellation of full advance payment for securities. In international practice, the practice of delivering and paying for securities a few days after the deal, has long been accepted. This is more convenient for most investors and we are interested in implementing it as soon as possible. Naturally, I hope that all the advantages and disadvantages will be taken into account when we plan for introducing the system so that these innovations do not result in the creation of any financial bubbles. Such innovations reduce the cost of capital for Russian companies and the economy in general, and increase the capacity of the domestic financial market. One of the solutions that will determine the future of the Russian financial market is the consolidation of MICEX [Moscow International Currency Exchange] and RTS [Russian Trading System] exchanges. In the future, this will create a single, absolutely competitive world-class trading platform, which will determine the price for Russian assets and resources. I would like to note that the working group for the establishment of an international financial centre in Moscow is currently analysing various aspects of improving this area and drafting a roadmap. We expect that it will be approved by the end of the year. The efforts of the Russian Direct Investment Fund are also aimed at the diversification of investment projects in our economy. We have agreed to allocate 62 billion rubles [$2 billion] to the fund every year: we allocated 62 billion last year and will give it another 62 billion this year. We will also consider doing this next year. The budget for 2013 does not have the money for that, but we will have to find it because, as I have already said, our budget should not only be socially oriented, but it should also be a development budget. How could this be achieved without using such instruments as the Direct Investment Fund? This is the best and the most effective tool that has proved itself around the world. It will work here in Russia too. Since its establishment in July 2011, the fund has allocated 7.7 billion rubles for financing investment projects, and the funding it attracted from co-investors exceeded 25 billion rubles [$ 830 million]. Another major step forward was the formation of a consortium which included the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and a number of international investment funds – almost all of the world's largest investment funds. It has already begun to invest in Russian companies that are planning share placement in the MICEX-RTS common exchange platform. We intend to encourage domestic and foreign investors and thus resolve the shortage of long-term money. This issue is of concern to everyone. Our financial system is not yet ready to offer such investment resources to the extent in which it is necessary for economic development, but we are well aware that this is not just an economic issue: people's trust in financial institutions and in businesses’ ability to implement various projects will largely depend on its solution. One of the sources is well known: it is the funded part of pensions. I must say that this is a major advantage of the system of funded pensions, which we created some years ago. A great deal of money has been accumulated: this year it will reach about two trillion rubles [$65 billion]. We were promised both by the former and the present Finance Ministers that at least part of the funds will be allocated for infrastructure development by issuing infrastructure bonds secured by these accumulated funds. I hope that concrete proposals are submitted by the end of this year. Throughout the world, this money is provided by the top players in the stock market: insurance companies, pension funds and so on. The issue of creating a so-called mega-regulator is currently widely discussed. This is another matter I would like to address. The Government proposes to merge the Federal Commission on Securities Market into a mega-regulator agency under the Central Bank. This idea has many supporters, although there are also some opponents (we have just discussed it again with some colleagues). I would like to invite the banking and investor community, as well as all interested parties to join the discussion. The matter should be resolved quickly. The question of radically improving the regulatory system is long overdue, and this decision should be made without delay. We must admit that Russians do not yet have enough information about the role of the financial market and the opportunities it presents. As a result, people often invest in the few vehicles they understand and trust – in real estate or in foreign currency, or just stash their savings away. Therefore, we are going to work on improving financial literacy, strengthening public confidence in the Russian financial sector and creating new tools, including those that provide protection from inflation. Improving corporate governance in state-owned companies remains an important task. This clearly provides an added bonus for the companies. Management at most businesses, or at least many of them, is not efficient enough. Therefore, the Government has been charged with the task of determining management efficiency criteria for state-owned companies in the near future, including by using the best international practices. Finally, another important point. The state will continue the privatisation of enterprises but it will do so judiciously. State assets will be sold in accordance with clear and transparent rules to the best and most efficient owners at fair market prices given the current economic environment. The federal property privatisation plan has been approved. Ultimately, we will sell state-owned stakes in virtually all non-commodity companies. The only exceptions are some natural monopolies and defence companies, where the state will remain the controlling shareholder in the foreseeable future. I emphasise that banks and other financial institution have the first place in the privatisation programmes of the largest blue chip companies. As you know, in February 2011, a 10% stake in VTB was successfully privatised for $3.3 billion, and in September 2012, 7.6% of Sberbank shares worth more than $5.2 billion were sold. This was one of the most successful deals in the past 10 years. As I recall, for every $100 Sberbank invested 10 years ago it got $700 – this really was one of the best deals of the decade. Both of these sales saw good demand and relatively high prices given the current state of the market. This clearly shows that Russian financial institutions retain their appeal despite the challenges faced by the global financial market. Ladies and gentlemen, It is axiomatic that capital tends to flow where investors consider the balance of risk and return to be optimal. Today both the global and the Russian economy need trust. To win the investors’ trust means to discover new horizons, and that is what we are striving for. We hope that foreign and Russian investors will appreciate the achievements of our economy and commit to long-term and large-scale investment cooperation. We will pursue this aim and we are open to it, as I have already said. Finally, I want to thank the VTB Bank for organising this forum and continuing the tradition of such important and beneficial meetings in our country, in the Russian capital. Thank you for your attention. <…> Vladimir Putin: We heard from our colleagues just now, starting with our Chinese friend. He noted – and our European colleague later noted too – that our low government debt is one of our economy’s main strong points. It currently stands at 10 percent of GDP, of which 2.5 percent is external debt. We also have a minimal deficit. This is important too. Last year, we had a primary budget surplus of 0.8 percent. In other words, there are no reasons for an increase in our debt. This does not mean that the Finance Ministry cannot take advantage of the favourable circumstances and a relatively low borrowing cost for Russia to borrow now and then withdraw again in the event of future turbulence and higher lending costs and rely on domestic reserves instead. This kind of move is entirely possible. But the fact remains that a low debt ratio and low inflation, or absence of inflation, are fundamental advantages. Our Chinese colleague spoke about the Chinese economy’s need to rely more on domestic demand. India offers a good example in this respect. It has been practically unaffected by the global crisis situation of these recent times and illustrates well the importance of being able to rely on domestic demand. Could we achieve this kind of self-reliance? I have some big doubts in this respect because to be able to have this kind of confidence we would need to make big strides in diversifying our economy. As our American friend noted, so long as we still depend so heavily on oil and gas exports we have little possibility of relying on domestic demand. But this is nonetheless an objective, not only for our friends in China, but for Russia too.  I note that our relations with China are developing very well indeed. Our bilateral trade reached a figure of $83.5 billion last year and will be even higher this year. This puts China in first place among our trading partners, ahead by a long way of Germany, and our trade continues to grow, which is good to see. The diversification process is not a simple one, but our trade and economic ties are nonetheless moving in this direction, with goods from the machine-building and other sectors and not just the hydrocarbons but also nuclear energy – advanced technology, in other words – accounting for a substantial share. We will continue in this direction. We have many big joint projects and good plans, which of course we must not just think about but actually carry out. As for the situation in Europe, everyone is busy criticising Europe these days, and this event’s host also began by doing so. But Europe is not in any worse a situation than the USA, say, which also has a big debt and not the best macroeconomic situation at the moment. Where the Europeans run into bigger problems compared to others is that, as our European colleague said, they have “17 captains” at the helm. This makes things more difficult of course because it is hard to set rules and find solutions acceptable to all. The problem is not even so much that there are 17 captains, but that they are all sailing under different sails. You’ve got one in a flash yacht and someone else in a dinghy, and altogether this makes a whole flotilla. It’s even worse when someone’s dinghy springs a leak and they have to bail out the water the whole time. This all makes it hard to reach a consensus. Correct me if I’m a little off in the figures, but when France has average per capita income of 3,600–3,800 euros, and Romania has average per capita income of 260–280 euros, it is not easy to find consensus solutions.  Our European friend spoke of the need for budget consolidation in Europe. This is necessary, certainly, given that there are no borders and there’s a common space. People in Romania want to live as well as people in France do. They are all part of the same common community after all. But they hear instead, “No, you were poor before and you’ll be even poorer now.” Of course they don’t want to agree to this. It’s hard to convince the Greeks too, and the Spanish and Portuguese, who have had the chance to taste cheap money. This is a very complicated process that demands a clear understanding of where the common interest lies. In this sense I do not envy our European partners because they really do face some difficult tasks ahead.  <…> Vladimir Putin: Following the discussions going on in the European Union and knowing the position of many European leaders, what makes me optimistic is that there is a common understanding on the fundamental concepts. This is very important. I am sure that this consolidation and common understanding of the problems and exit solutions from the crisis will help Europe to find a stable development road and change its situation for the better. I do not think that the world’s leading economies should have to shoulder the entire burden because they also have limitations, including domestic, political and social limitations. Everyone knows that I have many friends in Germany. One friend is visiting just now. Her daughter works as a nurse and has three children, I think. Her husband is studying, and she makes a little more than 2,000 euros, and that’s it. There are many people like this in Germany, and they pay high taxes there, and have to pay for their housing. Putting too much pressure on the social sector would be counterproductive therefore even in the world’s leading economies, and could lead to serious consequences. But the European leaders and the European Commission are clearly set on resolving the macroeconomic problems, consolidating finances, and carrying out structural reforms. Their determination is evident and we wish them success in this work. I am sure that they will succeed. As for Russia, our colleague noted just before that we have a growth rate of 4 percent, which is a good performance compared to other economies. But this is not enough for us. As I have said on many occasions, and our experts and all of us know, for us to be able to reach our economic objectives we need to grow even faster. Our actual economic planning is based on a figure of 4 percent or slightly more for the period through to 2015–2016, but we need even higher growth. Our American colleague noted our dependence on energy exports. Yes, this remains the situation and earnings from energy exports have increased. Budget revenue from energy exports have increased of late, it is true, but though oil and gas production is also up, the increase is not significant. Production fell a little during the crisis period, but overall, Russia was the world’s biggest producer last year. Our oil companies are now producing more oil than the world leaders, even ExxonMobil, if we take just oil. If we take oil products overall ExxonMobil produces more. It is not the increase in production that is the main thing however, but the price rise. Prices have risen to their current level and have stabilised there. It would be foolish of us to sell our products below the market price. It is another matter however that we should consolidate part of these oil revenues in reserve funds, as I spoke about. First, we did this in the past, and second, we have now begun applying the budget rule that I outlined in my opening remarks. The main task is for the Government to keep within the parameters set by this budget rule. This sets strict requirements for planning the budget, but it is a necessary approach and reliable system to protect us against possible future crises. Regarding infrastructure, I cannot but agree with you, as everyone knows what a longstanding problem this is in Russia. Unfortunately, these problems remain today, things like bad roads. Like you said, if the winter road has ‘melted’, what is there to do? There are only two options: either we abolish summer, or we build proper roads. We can’t abolish summer, and so the Finance Ministry will have to open its purse and put money built up in the pension funds, say, into issuing infrastructure bonds. There is another method, which we are starting to use now. You mentioned Mr Kudrin, who at one time proposed a 13-percent flat-rate income tax. This was the right decision, we went along with it and tax collection did indeed improve dramatically. Mr Kudrin’s name tag is here, but he himself is not. Having left the executive government he seems to think he can flout discipline and is out and about somewhere now. But it was Mr Kudrin who persuaded me back then to abolish the road funds, so you should direct your complaints to him next time you see him.  We have re-established these funds, although in a somewhat different form now and with different financing sources. The federal and regional funds have been re-established however. They will build up quite substantial funds, far more that the regions had at their disposal for these purposes. I hope that we will make further progress in all of these areas, issuing infrastructure bonds, increasing direct financing from the federal budget, and developing the regional road funds. Resolving this problem will be a gradual process, but we will certainly resolve it.  <…> Question: Mr President, I have a question about inflation. Inflation was at a record low of 3.6 percent over the first half of the year but has now risen to 6 percent. Is the Government willing to sacrifice to short-term economic advantages for the sake of guaranteeing long-term economic stability and bringing down inflation? Vladimir Putin: First, inflation was low in the first half because we decided to raise the prices for natural monopolies’ services only in the second half, and the prices thus started rising in July. We expected that the prices would rise, the monetary supply would increase, and this would affect inflation in the second half.  Second, we see that food prices are rising now. This is related to the drought that has affected big producer countries, including the United States. This also has a considerable impact on the domestic situation. Our grain prices are rising too after all. By the way, I draw to the Government’s attention that in 2011 and 2010 we took quite energetic measures in response, including with the help of the grain reserves. We need to look at how best to respond to this situation, which has arisen from natural causes. Should we sacrifice something and try at whatever cost to maintain macroeconomic indicators, including a low inflation level, even if it means sacrificing economic growth? This is the choice facing all European countries today. I am sure my colleague will correct me if I’m wrong, but the whole debate today is about precisely this. Some countries get told to consolidate their budgets and cut spending, and they reply that if they do so they won’t have economic growth. So there won’t be growth – you’ll just have to bear it a while, the argument goes on. It’s a very difficult choice. We don’t even have to look as far as Europe. Our neighbours in Ukraine are in the opposite predicament. They have no inflation problem but have lending rates at around 20 percent and zero growth. Is this good or bad? Probably it is a problem.  I therefore think that we are going to have to make our way between a rock and hard place and keep a check on inflation of course, while monitoring at the same time what impact the Government’s response measures have on the real sector of the economy. We need to boost domestic demand, but how do we stimulate domestic demand if we do not get the economy growing? This is in many ways an art more than anything, something that requires a very fine touch indeed. Can we do this? Yes, we can. But ultimately, the main thing is to suppress inflation of course.  Question: Most of those present are financial investors. Corporate governance is an issue of concern to all. This concerns various interested party transactions, transfer prices, good faith work on the lending market, and so on. You know that the institutions of corporate governance are still far from perfect today. As part of the work on building the international financial centre you mentioned, amendments to the Civil Code were drafted last year and were passed in the first reading at the start of this year. This was followed by heated debate, with most objections coming from big companies, which, not so surprisingly, oppose bringing order to this area.  Do you have a position on this issue, and can we count on your support? Vladimir Putin: Yes, of course I have a position on this issue and am familiar with the discussion. We planned to pass the amendments to the Civil Code at the end of last year, and worked hard on this in the Government and the Presidential Executive Office. But you are right – many doubts and reservations were expressed. The Civil Code is essentially the economy’s constitution, and in this sense there is no place for hasty action. We must study all of the market actors’ concerns very carefully and listen to everyone, including the portfolio investors and our own big infrastructure companies. I know their concerns in detail. They tell me about their worries. A decision will of course be made in the end. We want portfolio investors to find a comfortable environment here and will try hard to clear the road for them as thoroughly as we can, but do so in such a way as to not cause any damage the other market actors. Decisions will be made.  Question: I have a question about the budget. Last year, you promised to increase social spending and public sector wages. This is understandable given the delicate economic situation at the moment, but if problems continue in the future, how will you finance social spending? Vladimir Putin: We are indeed addressing the social problems we consider the urgent priorities. Let me note however that incomes in Russia are substantially lower than in the main developed economies. Yes, at the height of the crisis we did increase pensions, but our pensioners received so little to start with that despite our hesitations and concerns this increase did not really affect the inflation situation or the budget, which remained within the parameters we had planned. We raised service pay too for our military service members. If you look at the overall money supply you will see that this has not affected our macroeconomic indicators. Naturally, we now have to bring other sectors in line with our guideline parameters, above all the banking sector. We decided to accord grants in education and raise wages for teachers and professors, and have just taken the decision to raise wages for people in the culture sector, but do you know how much these people actually earn in this sector? In real terms, they earn very little indeed – 8,000–9,000 rubles a month on average.  These are therefore steps we must take whatever the situation, because if people perceive society as socially unjust it will not be effective overall and people will not have confidence in our economic measures. We talk about our good macroeconomic indicators and growing reserves, but people do not see this reflected in their own lives at all, and this is an unacceptable situation. What are we living and working for if people don’t see the results? Everything must be balanced, but these wage rises and grants will not harm the macroeconomic situation. There are other issues here that we need to reflect on and resolve. The average wage in Russia last year – not public sector wages, not wages paid for with budget money – was 24,000 rubles, 23,700 or 23,800 to be more precise. This year it will be 28,800 – close to 29,000. That is the result of natural growth. This is the national average. Knowing this figure, how can we not bring pay for people in the social services sector, for example, teachers, or health workers closer into line with it? It would be a big mistake if we returned to the times when people working in these sectors say, “You pretend to pay us and we will pretend to work, pretend to teach you or treat you.” This is unacceptable. Balanced solutions must be found, certainly, but people in these sectors should be paid in line with real incomes around the country as a whole. Question: Establishing the Central Depositary has made the Russian stock market more convenient for foreign investors. But without changes to tax laws the procedures for paying taxes will become even more complicated for foreign investors. Do you plan to simplify these rules in any way?  Vladimir Putin: We are aware of the problem and are making amendments to the Tax Code.  Question: The annual cost of corruption in Russia comes to around a quarter of the country’s GDP and maybe even a lot more. We read in the papers, say, that Gazprom buys large-diameter pipes not directly, but through a specific company, which, according to Interfax, adds on a mark-up of around 30 percent. There are plenty more examples in this vein.  You have five-and-a-half years of your presidential term ahead. Do you want to go down in history as the man who restructured Gazprom so as to make investors happy and have the country working normally, transparently and so on? Vladimir Putin: Our infrastructure companies have the same flaws and problems as our whole economy and society in general, of course. At the same time we see, for example, how a whole campaign against Gazprom has been unleashed in European countries. They are looking for evidence of a monopoly hold on the market and a while ago carried out seizures of documents. Let me note however that Gazprom holds 27 percent of the market in Europe, I think, and Norwegian companies hold 29 percent. So, what kind of monopoly is there to talk about? In this respect we hear more and more reproaches about how Gazprom conducts business and allegations of corruption. There probably is corruption there, but in this case it is the police’s job to catch those responsible and put them in prison. That would be the right thing to do, I think.  This is not enough, however. Looking at the matter seriously, we need to change the economy of a company like this and guarantee its access to transport systems, especially the pipeline systems. This is the main thing we need to do. But we should not follow the approach our European colleagues embodied in the Third Energy Package with their division of production, transport, and distribution into separate businesses, thinking that this will lead to lower energy prices, including lower gas prices in Europe. You cannot separate transport into a viable business all of its own. It usually exists through cross subsidies that come through the production and sales side of the business. Transport as a separate business has no real interest, but the Third Energy Package makes it separate. This is a very dangerous thing, as we have told our partners many times, and so we need to be very careful and thorough in dealing with these matters. As for bringing down prices for final consumers, including in Europe, I recommend looking at the price formation structure. Look at the share of taxes, for example. The final consumer pays a price that is 60-percent made up of taxes. Why do our partners want us to lower our companies’ revenues while they get to leave all of their taxes in place? I understand of course that these taxes can be collected and put into social spending, and in today’s situation they naturally do not want to lose this source of funds. You mentioned Gazprom’s contract purchases just before. I am aware of this matter and have given repeated instructions to the law enforcement agencies. They are constantly working on the situation, digging something up, making arrests. In Europe, gas goes through several intermediary dealers on its way to the final consumer. Maybe they should be removed from the chain? Who benefits from their being there? So, let’s look at the whole chain – from the producers to the final consumers. If we can work together to take a real objective look at the whole situation we will probably achieve results. Of course during my time in office as President I want to do as much as I possibly can for Russia. This is my basic aim and I will plan my work accordingly.  Question: Mr President, I have a question pertaining to what you said about diversifying the Russian economy so it is less dependent on raw materials. An important aspect is implementing modern industrial technologies. Over the last several years, the government is doing a great deal in this area, but one has the impression that neither private Russian businesses nor the companies with government participation are actively working on innovations in practice, rather than on paper, and in this area, Russia needs to “run to stay in place.” So my question is as follows: does the government plan to create more incentives for innovation in the Russian economy, including through the use of the other part of the carrot-and-stick motivation scheme – the stick? Vladimir Putin: It’s hard to use the stick in the economy – it’s a way to be certain not to get results. We need incentives, and naturally, we have spoken about this many times, and it is stated in our documents: “The diversification of the economy and its innovative development are key objectives in our economic activity.” There are many areas of work that we think should lead us to the desired result. First and most important among them (and we are discussing this today, approaching it from many angles) is ensuring macroeconomic stability and defeating inflation. We are creating tax incentives for companies that are working in the field of innovation. Perhaps this is not enough, and I understand our Finance Ministry when the Economic Development Ministry and other colleagues constantly insist on lowering taxes in this sector, and increasing them in others. There is a constant battle for the fiscal interests of the budget, but ultimately, we will continue to proceed in this direction. And finally, special support measures. For example, one of the approaches we must maintain is support measures for high-tech exports. We must maintain the support for specific areas that are pulling the overall innovative development of the economy like a locomotive. What do I mean? The aerospace sector, for example. Even in 2009, when Russia suffered a severe drop in industrial production, when everything fell by over seven percent, even more than in other nations – 7.8 or 7.7 percent – the aerospace sector grew by 17 per cent. The same happened in some other sectors of the economy into which the government was purposefully channelling resources. We are determined to continue this in the future. And, of course, we need to support innovative projects. This is a separate, major topic where we clearly need to do more. Question: I am working at Tradewinds Global Investors in the United States and I am responsible for all capital investments in the housing and public utilities sector. Could you say a few words about this sector? Today, unfortunately, it is very difficult to invest in this sector; plans for capital investments are bad, investors do not know what to expect in the future from this sector of the economy, and it has a high level of inefficiency in Russia. Do you have plans to restore the investment status of this sector, and are you interested in attracting private investors for this purpose? Vladimir Putin: I see you’re really giving me a hard time here. This is one of our most difficult, sorest issues. You know what the problem is with this sector? It’s that it was created as absolutely ineffective and unprofitable. That is the problem. After all, heat and energy supplies were not calculated in any way; things were built any which way, and nobody in the Soviet Union ever counted kilocalories or tonnes of furnace oil. That is the reality. In order for all this to be refitted, to be put on a different, modern footing, we will certainly need huge investments. That is the first part of the problem. The second part is that the government is not capable of doing it all at once. If we place this burden on our citizens, people will be unhappy; I simply think it would be unfair and impossible. It would be a real burden for people, and utterly unaffordable. This is very difficult. So if we do it, we need to do it step by step, and it is best to start with the newly built residential districts. And the third part is that, quite frankly, we have been unable to develop effective, efficient mechanisms for reforming this sector. Everything attempted so far – housing cooperatives and such – has not worked as effectively as people thought it would. But the potential investment attractiveness of this sector is extremely high. In order for everything we came up with and which is planned for the future to work effectively, we need to resolve another very important challenge, which our colleague from Finland drew attention to. We need to radically reduce opportunities for corruption in this sector, because these various offices and small firms are single players on the market and are usually financed directly via municipal budgets. Nobody else is allowed in there. This municipal mini-monopolism kills the entire system at the root, because it increases costs and does not improve the quality of service. This is an enormous area of work that will need to be dealt with. But it is entirely clear that this is one of the most serious challenges for the budget – because of the enormous funding being channelled there from the budget – as well as for the economy overall, and for citizens. VTB Bank CEO Andrei Kostin: Mr President, I would like to ask a question, but please answer it a little later. It is no secret that your birthday is coming up. A jubilee is always a cause for celebration, but it is also a cause to truly consider the path one has walked and to think about what one wants in the future. My question is as follows. What do you feel is the most important thing you have done in your life to date, and what is the most important thing you would still like to do in life? In order to give you time to think, I would like to invite you to speak at our next forum and answer that question there, if you have that opportunity. Thank you very much. Thanks to all the other participants on our panel. I wish you all success, health and happiness. Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. I would like to thank you for this business-oriented and very positive approach to discussing even the most difficult issues and problems that we talked about today.\", 'kremlin_id': 16569, 'place': 'Moscow', 'title': 'VTB Capital RUSSIA CALLING! Investment Forum', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin took part in the plenary session of the VTB Capital RUSSIA CALLING! Investment Forum.', 'tags': ['Economy and finance'], 'transcript_filtered': \"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to welcome once again to Moscow representatives of major companies, business leaders and investors. Despite its youth, the forum organised on the initiative of VTB Bank has become a significant event in the economic life of our country and in the international calendar of such events. It serves as a useful platform for open discussions on complex economic issues and elaborating new approaches to the investment policy. The name of the RUSSIA CALLING! forum reflects the nature of our policy of openness and partnership. Our goal is to maximise the profitability of investing in Russia, working in Russia, creating new jobs and setting up production here. We see this as a real indicator of our country’s competitiveness and the efficiency of all major state and economic institutions. The main question is what to do first to transform Russia into a centre of attraction for foreign and not only foreign but first and foremost our own domestic investments and capital, to make sure it obtains the necessary resources for modernisation and further economic growth. Today, Russia has an impressive potential for sustainable development. It is among the world leaders in terms of key macroeconomic stability indicators. National debt, as you know, is only about 10% of GDP, and the debt to foreign investors, our lenders is only 2.5%. Foreign currency reserves at the end of September reached $522 billion. Inflation fell below 7%; we repeatedly cited these figure: 6.1% last year, the lowest inflation rate in 20 years. We expect it to fall to below 5% by 2014. Keeping inflation down remains one of our top priorities. We did not restrict the freedom of capital flow even during the global economic crisis, although the temptation was there and experts suggested this course of action. We could have introduced such restrictions to protect our interests, but we chose not to do so because we believed that tactical losses could become strategic, and it is better to wait it out, to gather strength and hold out in this difficult situation. Investment inflows in the period from 2009 to 2011 amounted to 3% of GDP. This is above the average global level. In comparison, this figure in European countries, Brazil, China and India did not exceed 2% of GDP in the same period. Moreover, the main sources of investment in Russia were Germany, France, Sweden and the Netherlands, in addition to the traditional offshore zones. We realise that investment from the Netherlands and Cyprus is the repatriation of Russian capital, but that is good as well. Today, despite the slowdown in almost all neighbouring regions, our economy continues to grow. According to the Economic Development Ministry, GDP grew by 4% in the first eight months of 2012, and experts believe that this trend will continue on average over the next three years. Although lower than before the crisis, this growth is much more balanced and higher quality. Actually, just the fact that there is any growth at all is a positive development because we don’t see it much in the current global economic climate. I want to emphasise that this growth is not based on a steady increase in oil prices or amassing foreign debt by banks and companies. That is, this growth is not based on oil revenues and debt bubbles. Naturally, I will admit that the commodity market has been doing well and that has had a positive impact on our economy, but it has not been booming either. However, we also take into account the serious risks associated with the uncertain situation on foreign markets. We cannot but be concerned by the clear signs of recession in some European countries – and the European Union, as you know, is our largest trade and economic partner: more than 50% of Russia’s trade is with EU countries. Industrial production and GDP have slowed down in China and social tension is growing in a number of countries, which is a negative phenomenon in itself but it also has a harmful effect on the economy. We certainly hope that the measures taken by our partners will improve the situation. For our part, however, will be do our utmost to protect our interests against any negative developments in the European and in the global economy. Thus, in drafting the budget for 2013–2015, we implemented the budget rule for the first time. We began to work on it two years ago and discussed it at length. In fact, the main parameters of this rule were worked out by the end of 2011, and now the Government has finalised and adopted it. The budget rule logic is based on the premise that the dependence of the Russian budget on oil prices must decrease. This will be a stable long-term trend. Over the next three years, the deficit of non-oil and gas revenues will fall from 10.5% of GDP in 2012 to 8.5% in 2015. I must say that the budget rule is a necessity for us because the revenues from the oil and gas sector will inevitably decline and our fiscal policy cannot ignore this. In case of a severe change in the global economy in 2013, the budget provides for anti-crisis measures, including redistribution mechanisms for budgetary allocations, for example, the option to invest up to 150 billion rubles [$5 billion] in the recapitalisation of the banking sector should there be a crisis. We don’t expect it to happen but, if required, this can be done through the exchange of federal bonds for bank securities. In addition, in some important and strategic industries companies can be granted further state guarantees. Together, these measures will help stabilise the economy in almost any scenario. However, we see the main guarantee of stability in the policy aimed at supporting growth and promoting business, trade and investment. In this regard, I would like to mention the landmark event of the year: Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation. For us, participation in this organisation is a key foreign economic priority. We hope that this step will have a positive effect on the investors’ attitude and will pave the way for promising long-term projects. We have always believed that accession to the WTO will make our economy and the rules by which it operates more transparent and understandable to investors from any country around the world that is a member of this organisation. In the coming years, we intend to join the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Ladies and gentlemen, Today the positive dynamic of the Russian economy, the accumulated safety factors and our reserves allow us to set new ambitious goals. At the same time, we realise that there are no simple solutions or easy growth opportunities. Just three or four years ago, the world believed that global problems could be quickly resolved. Now everyone has realised that we need time and unconventional approaches to overcome the challenges we face. We must substantially alter the basic economic development model in order to recover from the current crisis. Such changes will affect virtually all economies in the world, and attempts to cling to the old formulas will only preserve the problems. We must stimulate structural change, create the conditions for the emergence of new economic sectors and look for modern sources of growth. We are aware that this requirement has a direct impact on our economic policy. Against the background of global change, including in the energy sector, we have to radically accelerate the diversification of the national economy and technological innovation, which is extremely important. We must move to a new technological structure. The potential of growth through the exploitation of long-existing capacities has been practically exhausted. This is evidenced by a low unemployment rate compared to the level of the past 20 years. We certainly believe that this is an economic and social achievement but it also shows us that growth based on the old production capacities is no longer possible. We have a 5.1% unemployment rate – one of the lowest in Europe and in the world. Further growth is possible only through investment in new manufacturing facilities and upgrading the existing ones, as well as investment in human resources development. We aim to create or update at least 25 million jobs by 2020. By the way, this is an initiative introduced by one of the business associations, and I think it is absolutely correct. At first glance, it seems very difficult, perhaps even impossible, but our experts have made calculations along with this association and have concluded that it is possible. I do not mean the creation of entirely new jobs but rather upgrading and restructuring the jobs that already exist. All of this can lead to 25 million high-level and well-paid jobs. By 2018, we aim to increase work productivity by 1.5 times compared with 2011 and the share of high-tech and knowledge-intensive industries in the GDP by 1.3 times. By 2015, investment is expected to grow to at least 25% of GDP, and to 27% by 2018. We have already launched active efforts to achieve the stated objectives. Thus, we are developing roadmaps together with the business community for specific areas of improving the business climate and we will monitor their implementation together with the business community. The Russian regions will play a central role in improving the business climate and attracting investors. Before the crisis, a healthy competition emerged among our regions in a bid to attract investment. The leading regions were able to dramatically change the structure of their economy. Last year, the Agency for Strategic Initiatives launched an important pilot project with the participation of the business community: the introduction of a regional government standard for improving the investment climate. Best practices of cooperation with investors should become the norm for all regional administrations. We invite investors to cooperate actively with the regions and with the Agency for Strategic Initiatives, and to determine together the best approaches to the improvement of the business environment. I will reiterate: Russia is open to foreign direct investment and domestic investment in industry, services, agriculture and the innovation sector. We hope that capital will be followed by technology, management experience and modern models of production, distribution and service networks, which our foreign partners have. Domestic financial market infrastructure development is a major priority for us. This means enhancing its stability, establishing an international financial centre in Moscow and developing modern investment instruments. All this will allow our companies to quickly and easily raise capital from domestic and foreign sources. The Central Depository will begin to operate by November. Its goal is to help foreign investors enter the Russian financial market, to make the system of securities title recording more transparent and understandable. With the adoption of the laws On Clearing and Clearing Activities and On Organised Trading we have created the necessary legal conditions for the development of financial market infrastructure entities: exchanges and the central counterparty. They will operate in accordance with international standards, significantly reducing the risk for market participants. Our agenda includes the cancellation of full advance payment for securities. In international practice, the practice of delivering and paying for securities a few days after the deal, has long been accepted. This is more convenient for most investors and we are interested in implementing it as soon as possible. Naturally, I hope that all the advantages and disadvantages will be taken into account when we plan for introducing the system so that these innovations do not result in the creation of any financial bubbles. Such innovations reduce the cost of capital for Russian companies and the economy in general, and increase the capacity of the domestic financial market. One of the solutions that will determine the future of the Russian financial market is the consolidation of MICEX [Moscow International Currency Exchange] and RTS [Russian Trading System] exchanges. In the future, this will create a single, absolutely competitive world-class trading platform, which will determine the price for Russian assets and resources. I would like to note that the working group for the establishment of an international financial centre in Moscow is currently analysing various aspects of improving this area and drafting a roadmap. We expect that it will be approved by the end of the year. The efforts of the Russian Direct Investment Fund are also aimed at the diversification of investment projects in our economy. We have agreed to allocate 62 billion rubles [$2 billion] to the fund every year: we allocated 62 billion last year and will give it another 62 billion this year. We will also consider doing this next year. The budget for 2013 does not have the money for that, but we will have to find it because, as I have already said, our budget should not only be socially oriented, but it should also be a development budget. How could this be achieved without using such instruments as the Direct Investment Fund? This is the best and the most effective tool that has proved itself around the world. It will work here in Russia too. Since its establishment in July 2011, the fund has allocated 7.7 billion rubles for financing investment projects, and the funding it attracted from co-investors exceeded 25 billion rubles [$ 830 million]. Another major step forward was the formation of a consortium which included the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and a number of international investment funds – almost all of the world's largest investment funds. It has already begun to invest in Russian companies that are planning share placement in the MICEX-RTS common exchange platform. We intend to encourage domestic and foreign investors and thus resolve the shortage of long-term money. This issue is of concern to everyone. Our financial system is not yet ready to offer such investment resources to the extent in which it is necessary for economic development, but we are well aware that this is not just an economic issue: people's trust in financial institutions and in businesses’ ability to implement various projects will largely depend on its solution. One of the sources is well known: it is the funded part of pensions. I must say that this is a major advantage of the system of funded pensions, which we created some years ago. A great deal of money has been accumulated: this year it will reach about two trillion rubles [$65 billion]. We were promised both by the former and the present Finance Ministers that at least part of the funds will be allocated for infrastructure development by issuing infrastructure bonds secured by these accumulated funds. I hope that concrete proposals are submitted by the end of this year. Throughout the world, this money is provided by the top players in the stock market: insurance companies, pension funds and so on. The issue of creating a so-called mega-regulator is currently widely discussed. This is another matter I would like to address. The Government proposes to merge the Federal Commission on Securities Market into a mega-regulator agency under the Central Bank. This idea has many supporters, although there are also some opponents (we have just discussed it again with some colleagues). I would like to invite the banking and investor community, as well as all interested parties to join the discussion. The matter should be resolved quickly. The question of radically improving the regulatory system is long overdue, and this decision should be made without delay. We must admit that Russians do not yet have enough information about the role of the financial market and the opportunities it presents. As a result, people often invest in the few vehicles they understand and trust – in real estate or in foreign currency, or just stash their savings away. Therefore, we are going to work on improving financial literacy, strengthening public confidence in the Russian financial sector and creating new tools, including those that provide protection from inflation. Improving corporate governance in state-owned companies remains an important task. This clearly provides an added bonus for the companies. Management at most businesses, or at least many of them, is not efficient enough. Therefore, the Government has been charged with the task of determining management efficiency criteria for state-owned companies in the near future, including by using the best international practices. Finally, another important point. The state will continue the privatisation of enterprises but it will do so judiciously. State assets will be sold in accordance with clear and transparent rules to the best and most efficient owners at fair market prices given the current economic environment. The federal property privatisation plan has been approved. Ultimately, we will sell state-owned stakes in virtually all non-commodity companies. The only exceptions are some natural monopolies and defence companies, where the state will remain the controlling shareholder in the foreseeable future. I emphasise that banks and other financial institution have the first place in the privatisation programmes of the largest blue chip companies. As you know, in February 2011, a 10% stake in VTB was successfully privatised for $3.3 billion, and in September 2012, 7.6% of Sberbank shares worth more than $5.2 billion were sold. This was one of the most successful deals in the past 10 years. As I recall, for every $100 Sberbank invested 10 years ago it got $700 – this really was one of the best deals of the decade. Both of these sales saw good demand and relatively high prices given the current state of the market. This clearly shows that Russian financial institutions retain their appeal despite the challenges faced by the global financial market. Ladies and gentlemen, It is axiomatic that capital tends to flow where investors consider the balance of risk and return to be optimal. Today both the global and the Russian economy need trust. To win the investors’ trust means to discover new horizons, and that is what we are striving for. We hope that foreign and Russian investors will appreciate the achievements of our economy and commit to long-term and large-scale investment cooperation. We will pursue this aim and we are open to it, as I have already said. Finally, I want to thank the VTB Bank for organising this forum and continuing the tradition of such important and beneficial meetings in our country, in the Russian capital. Thank you for your attention. <…> We heard from our colleagues just now, starting with our Chinese friend. He noted – and our European colleague later noted too – that our low government debt is one of our economy’s main strong points. It currently stands at 10 percent of GDP, of which 2.5 percent is external debt. We also have a minimal deficit. This is important too. Last year, we had a primary budget surplus of 0.8 percent. In other words, there are no reasons for an increase in our debt. This does not mean that the Finance Ministry cannot take advantage of the favourable circumstances and a relatively low borrowing cost for Russia to borrow now and then withdraw again in the event of future turbulence and higher lending costs and rely on domestic reserves instead. This kind of move is entirely possible. But the fact remains that a low debt ratio and low inflation, or absence of inflation, are fundamental advantages. Our Chinese colleague spoke about the Chinese economy’s need to rely more on domestic demand. India offers a good example in this respect. It has been practically unaffected by the global crisis situation of these recent times and illustrates well the importance of being able to rely on domestic demand. Could we achieve this kind of self-reliance? I have some big doubts in this respect because to be able to have this kind of confidence we would need to make big strides in diversifying our economy. As our American friend noted, so long as we still depend so heavily on oil and gas exports we have little possibility of relying on domestic demand. But this is nonetheless an objective, not only for our friends in China, but for Russia too.  I note that our relations with China are developing very well indeed. Our bilateral trade reached a figure of $83.5 billion last year and will be even higher this year. This puts China in first place among our trading partners, ahead by a long way of Germany, and our trade continues to grow, which is good to see. The diversification process is not a simple one, but our trade and economic ties are nonetheless moving in this direction, with goods from the machine-building and other sectors and not just the hydrocarbons but also nuclear energy – advanced technology, in other words – accounting for a substantial share. We will continue in this direction. We have many big joint projects and good plans, which of course we must not just think about but actually carry out. As for the situation in Europe, everyone is busy criticising Europe these days, and this event’s host also began by doing so. But Europe is not in any worse a situation than the USA, say, which also has a big debt and not the best macroeconomic situation at the moment. Where the Europeans run into bigger problems compared to others is that, as our European colleague said, they have “17 captains” at the helm. This makes things more difficult of course because it is hard to set rules and find solutions acceptable to all. The problem is not even so much that there are 17 captains, but that they are all sailing under different sails. You’ve got one in a flash yacht and someone else in a dinghy, and altogether this makes a whole flotilla. It’s even worse when someone’s dinghy springs a leak and they have to bail out the water the whole time. This all makes it hard to reach a consensus. Correct me if I’m a little off in the figures, but when France has average per capita income of 3,600–3,800 euros, and Romania has average per capita income of 260–280 euros, it is not easy to find consensus solutions.  Our European friend spoke of the need for budget consolidation in Europe. This is necessary, certainly, given that there are no borders and there’s a common space. People in Romania want to live as well as people in France do. They are all part of the same common community after all. But they hear instead, “No, you were poor before and you’ll be even poorer now.” Of course they don’t want to agree to this. It’s hard to convince the Greeks too, and the Spanish and Portuguese, who have had the chance to taste cheap money. This is a very complicated process that demands a clear understanding of where the common interest lies. In this sense I do not envy our European partners because they really do face some difficult tasks ahead.  <…> Following the discussions going on in the European Union and knowing the position of many European leaders, what makes me optimistic is that there is a common understanding on the fundamental concepts. This is very important. I am sure that this consolidation and common understanding of the problems and exit solutions from the crisis will help Europe to find a stable development road and change its situation for the better. I do not think that the world’s leading economies should have to shoulder the entire burden because they also have limitations, including domestic, political and social limitations. Everyone knows that I have many friends in Germany. One friend is visiting just now. Her daughter works as a nurse and has three children, I think. Her husband is studying, and she makes a little more than 2,000 euros, and that’s it. There are many people like this in Germany, and they pay high taxes there, and have to pay for their housing. Putting too much pressure on the social sector would be counterproductive therefore even in the world’s leading economies, and could lead to serious consequences. But the European leaders and the European Commission are clearly set on resolving the macroeconomic problems, consolidating finances, and carrying out structural reforms. Their determination is evident and we wish them success in this work. I am sure that they will succeed. As for Russia, our colleague noted just before that we have a growth rate of 4 percent, which is a good performance compared to other economies. But this is not enough for us. As I have said on many occasions, and our experts and all of us know, for us to be able to reach our economic objectives we need to grow even faster. Our actual economic planning is based on a figure of 4 percent or slightly more for the period through to 2015–2016, but we need even higher growth. Our American colleague noted our dependence on energy exports. Yes, this remains the situation and earnings from energy exports have increased. Budget revenue from energy exports have increased of late, it is true, but though oil and gas production is also up, the increase is not significant. Production fell a little during the crisis period, but overall, Russia was the world’s biggest producer last year. Our oil companies are now producing more oil than the world leaders, even ExxonMobil, if we take just oil. If we take oil products overall ExxonMobil produces more. It is not the increase in production that is the main thing however, but the price rise. Prices have risen to their current level and have stabilised there. It would be foolish of us to sell our products below the market price. It is another matter however that we should consolidate part of these oil revenues in reserve funds, as I spoke about. First, we did this in the past, and second, we have now begun applying the budget rule that I outlined in my opening remarks. The main task is for the Government to keep within the parameters set by this budget rule. This sets strict requirements for planning the budget, but it is a necessary approach and reliable system to protect us against possible future crises. Regarding infrastructure, I cannot but agree with you, as everyone knows what a longstanding problem this is in Russia. Unfortunately, these problems remain today, things like bad roads. Like you said, if the winter road has ‘melted’, what is there to do? There are only two options: either we abolish summer, or we build proper roads. We can’t abolish summer, and so the Finance Ministry will have to open its purse and put money built up in the pension funds, say, into issuing infrastructure bonds. There is another method, which we are starting to use now. You mentioned Mr Kudrin, who at one time proposed a 13-percent flat-rate income tax. This was the right decision, we went along with it and tax collection did indeed improve dramatically. Mr Kudrin’s name tag is here, but he himself is not. Having left the executive government he seems to think he can flout discipline and is out and about somewhere now. But it was Mr Kudrin who persuaded me back then to abolish the road funds, so you should direct your complaints to him next time you see him.  We have re-established these funds, although in a somewhat different form now and with different financing sources. The federal and regional funds have been re-established however. They will build up quite substantial funds, far more that the regions had at their disposal for these purposes. I hope that we will make further progress in all of these areas, issuing infrastructure bonds, increasing direct financing from the federal budget, and developing the regional road funds. Resolving this problem will be a gradual process, but we will certainly resolve it.  <…> First, inflation was low in the first half because we decided to raise the prices for natural monopolies’ services only in the second half, and the prices thus started rising in July. We expected that the prices would rise, the monetary supply would increase, and this would affect inflation in the second half. Second, we see that food prices are rising now. This is related to the drought that has affected big producer countries, including the United States. This also has a considerable impact on the domestic situation. Our grain prices are rising too after all. By the way, I draw to the Government’s attention that in 2011 and 2010 we took quite energetic measures in response, including with the help of the grain reserves. We need to look at how best to respond to this situation, which has arisen from natural causes. Should we sacrifice something and try at whatever cost to maintain macroeconomic indicators, including a low inflation level, even if it means sacrificing economic growth? This is the choice facing all European countries today. I am sure my colleague will correct me if I’m wrong, but the whole debate today is about precisely this. Some countries get told to consolidate their budgets and cut spending, and they reply that if they do so they won’t have economic growth. So there won’t be growth – you’ll just have to bear it a while, the argument goes on. It’s a very difficult choice. We don’t even have to look as far as Europe. Our neighbours in Ukraine are in the opposite predicament. They have no inflation problem but have lending rates at around 20 percent and zero growth. Is this good or bad? Probably it is a problem.  I therefore think that we are going to have to make our way between a rock and hard place and keep a check on inflation of course, while monitoring at the same time what impact the Government’s response measures have on the real sector of the economy. We need to boost domestic demand, but how do we stimulate domestic demand if we do not get the economy growing? This is in many ways an art more than anything, something that requires a very fine touch indeed. Can we do this? Yes, we can. But ultimately, the main thing is to suppress inflation of course.  Yes, of course I have a position on this issue and am familiar with the discussion. We planned to pass the amendments to the Civil Code at the end of last year, and worked hard on this in the Government and the Presidential Executive Office. But you are right – many doubts and reservations were expressed. The Civil Code is essentially the economy’s constitution, and in this sense there is no place for hasty action. We must study all of the market actors’ concerns very carefully and listen to everyone, including the portfolio investors and our own big infrastructure companies. I know their concerns in detail. They tell me about their worries. A decision will of course be made in the end. We want portfolio investors to find a comfortable environment here and will try hard to clear the road for them as thoroughly as we can, but do so in such a way as to not cause any damage the other market actors. Decisions will be made. We are indeed addressing the social problems we consider the urgent priorities. Let me note however that incomes in Russia are substantially lower than in the main developed economies. Yes, at the height of the crisis we did increase pensions, but our pensioners received so little to start with that despite our hesitations and concerns this increase did not really affect the inflation situation or the budget, which remained within the parameters we had planned. We raised service pay too for our military service members. If you look at the overall money supply you will see that this has not affected our macroeconomic indicators. Naturally, we now have to bring other sectors in line with our guideline parameters, above all the banking sector. We decided to accord grants in education and raise wages for teachers and professors, and have just taken the decision to raise wages for people in the culture sector, but do you know how much these people actually earn in this sector? In real terms, they earn very little indeed – 8,000–9,000 rubles a month on average.  These are therefore steps we must take whatever the situation, because if people perceive society as socially unjust it will not be effective overall and people will not have confidence in our economic measures. We talk about our good macroeconomic indicators and growing reserves, but people do not see this reflected in their own lives at all, and this is an unacceptable situation. What are we living and working for if people don’t see the results? Everything must be balanced, but these wage rises and grants will not harm the macroeconomic situation. There are other issues here that we need to reflect on and resolve. The average wage in Russia last year – not public sector wages, not wages paid for with budget money – was 24,000 rubles, 23,700 or 23,800 to be more precise. This year it will be 28,800 – close to 29,000. That is the result of natural growth. This is the national average. Knowing this figure, how can we not bring pay for people in the social services sector, for example, teachers, or health workers closer into line with it? It would be a big mistake if we returned to the times when people working in these sectors say, “You pretend to pay us and we will pretend to work, pretend to teach you or treat you.” This is unacceptable. Balanced solutions must be found, certainly, but people in these sectors should be paid in line with real incomes around the country as a whole. We are aware of the problem and are making amendments to the Tax Code. Our infrastructure companies have the same flaws and problems as our whole economy and society in general, of course. At the same time we see, for example, how a whole campaign against Gazprom has been unleashed in European countries. They are looking for evidence of a monopoly hold on the market and a while ago carried out seizures of documents. Let me note however that Gazprom holds 27 percent of the market in Europe, I think, and Norwegian companies hold 29 percent. So, what kind of monopoly is there to talk about? In this respect we hear more and more reproaches about how Gazprom conducts business and allegations of corruption. There probably is corruption there, but in this case it is the police’s job to catch those responsible and put them in prison. That would be the right thing to do, I think.  This is not enough, however. Looking at the matter seriously, we need to change the economy of a company like this and guarantee its access to transport systems, especially the pipeline systems. This is the main thing we need to do. But we should not follow the approach our European colleagues embodied in the Third Energy Package with their division of production, transport, and distribution into separate businesses, thinking that this will lead to lower energy prices, including lower gas prices in Europe. You cannot separate transport into a viable business all of its own. It usually exists through cross subsidies that come through the production and sales side of the business. Transport as a separate business has no real interest, but the Third Energy Package makes it separate. This is a very dangerous thing, as we have told our partners many times, and so we need to be very careful and thorough in dealing with these matters. As for bringing down prices for final consumers, including in Europe, I recommend looking at the price formation structure. Look at the share of taxes, for example. The final consumer pays a price that is 60-percent made up of taxes. Why do our partners want us to lower our companies’ revenues while they get to leave all of their taxes in place? I understand of course that these taxes can be collected and put into social spending, and in today’s situation they naturally do not want to lose this source of funds. You mentioned Gazprom’s contract purchases just before. I am aware of this matter and have given repeated instructions to the law enforcement agencies. They are constantly working on the situation, digging something up, making arrests. In Europe, gas goes through several intermediary dealers on its way to the final consumer. Maybe they should be removed from the chain? Who benefits from their being there? So, let’s look at the whole chain – from the producers to the final consumers. If we can work together to take a real objective look at the whole situation we will probably achieve results. Of course during my time in office as President I want to do as much as I possibly can for Russia. This is my basic aim and I will plan my work accordingly.  It’s hard to use the stick in the economy – it’s a way to be certain not to get results. We need incentives, and naturally, we have spoken about this many times, and it is stated in our documents: “The diversification of the economy and its innovative development are key objectives in our economic activity.” There are many areas of work that we think should lead us to the desired result. First and most important among them (and we are discussing this today, approaching it from many angles) is ensuring macroeconomic stability and defeating inflation. We are creating tax incentives for companies that are working in the field of innovation. Perhaps this is not enough, and I understand our Finance Ministry when the Economic Development Ministry and other colleagues constantly insist on lowering taxes in this sector, and increasing them in others. There is a constant battle for the fiscal interests of the budget, but ultimately, we will continue to proceed in this direction. And finally, special support measures. For example, one of the approaches we must maintain is support measures for high-tech exports. We must maintain the support for specific areas that are pulling the overall innovative development of the economy like a locomotive. What do I mean? The aerospace sector, for example. Even in 2009, when Russia suffered a severe drop in industrial production, when everything fell by over seven percent, even more than in other nations – 7.8 or 7.7 percent – the aerospace sector grew by 17 per cent. The same happened in some other sectors of the economy into which the government was purposefully channelling resources. We are determined to continue this in the future. And, of course, we need to support innovative projects. This is a separate, major topic where we clearly need to do more. I see you’re really giving me a hard time here. This is one of our most difficult, sorest issues. You know what the problem is with this sector? It’s that it was created as absolutely ineffective and unprofitable. That is the problem. After all, heat and energy supplies were not calculated in any way; things were built any which way, and nobody in the Soviet Union ever counted kilocalories or tonnes of furnace oil. That is the reality. In order for all this to be refitted, to be put on a different, modern footing, we will certainly need huge investments. That is the first part of the problem. The second part is that the government is not capable of doing it all at once. If we place this burden on our citizens, people will be unhappy; I simply think it would be unfair and impossible. It would be a real burden for people, and utterly unaffordable. This is very difficult. So if we do it, we need to do it step by step, and it is best to start with the newly built residential districts. And the third part is that, quite frankly, we have been unable to develop effective, efficient mechanisms for reforming this sector. Everything attempted so far – housing cooperatives and such – has not worked as effectively as people thought it would. But the potential investment attractiveness of this sector is extremely high. In order for everything we came up with and which is planned for the future to work effectively, we need to resolve another very important challenge, which our colleague from Finland drew attention to. We need to radically reduce opportunities for corruption in this sector, because these various offices and small firms are single players on the market and are usually financed directly via municipal budgets. Nobody else is allowed in there. This municipal mini-monopolism kills the entire system at the root, because it increases costs and does not improve the quality of service. This is an enormous area of work that will need to be dealt with. But it is entirely clear that this is one of the most serious challenges for the budget – because of the enormous funding being channelled there from the budget – as well as for the economy overall, and for citizens. Thank you very much. I would like to thank you for this business-oriented and very positive approach to discussing even the most difficult issues and problems that we talked about today.\", 'wordlist': ['good',

Mr Putin presented the main prize – the Big Crystal Pelican – to Vita Kirichenko, a Russian language and literature teacher at the Moscow Education Centre, and to Alexander Demakhin, who teaches world art at Sergiyev Posad High School. The President congratulated all teachers on their upcoming professional holiday – Teachers’ Day. Russia has been holding the Teacher of the Year competition since 1992. The competition takes place in several stages. Over 100,000 school teachers took part in the first selection round in 2012, and 77 people made it to the final.  * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, I want to congratulate you all and your colleagues on your upcoming professional holiday – Teachers’ Day, which falls on October 5. This is one of our most touching and symbolic holidays, comparable probably only to the Day of Knowledge on September 1, when we honour our schoolchildren, and their teachers too of course, and express our overall gratitude and respect for the noble work of the teachers and mentors who play such a big part in the lives of each and every one of us. Autumn marks the start of the school year, and so it is symbolically fitting that the final of the Teacher of the Year competition should take place at this time. The final is the most difficult and important round and the culmination of a whole year’s preparation. I know that there were more than 100,000 teachers taking part at the start of the competition. When I first glanced at the documents I thought they said 100 teachers, but then I looked more carefully and saw it was 100,000. This certainly makes for a big group of talented and worthy people.  Among them all, you have proven your right to be named as leaders in your profession in Russia. I am sincerely happy for you, for your schools, which are proud of you, and for your students of course. It is always a stroke of good fortune in childhood and youth to meet truly gifted teachers and mentors with knowledge and initiative, reflective and purposeful. There are teachers of different generations among the finalists. Some are young and others have years of experience and have already set hundreds of school graduates on the road into adult life. This shows that our young teachers are gaining experience fast, and that our older teachers are keeping pace with the times and constantly honing their skills. I recall when I visited a school – I think I mentioned it publicly at the time – I saw a teacher, already of a venerable age, sitting at a computer and working on the internet. “Do you find it interesting?” I asked her. “It’s so interesting that I don’t want to retire,” she replied. That is a good sign.  Russia’s teaching profession was always distinguished by the way it combines innovative spirit with faithfulness to tradition. This tight intertwining of continuity and development is very important for our national education system and for preserving the best in our teaching and education traditions. Our schools should be open to all that is new – in fact, this has always been the case – and at the same time, they should preserve what makes them unique, preserve the roots and values that our society has developed over the centuries, and not just teach, but nurture and develop people and citizens. I believe this is the approach that should underlie and shape our state education policy. We will develop this policy together, through direct dialogue with the teaching community, with you, friends. Teachers are set to play a bigger part in schools’ lives and in organising the teaching process. Training and professional development for teachers and a new wage payment system designed to encourage quality and conscientious work are all top priorities for developing our schools.  Our task is to give teachers working and living conditions worthy of their noble mission and to give the teaching profession greater prestige. It is after all a tremendous responsibility to teach and educate our children and devote one’s efforts to our schools, which lay the foundations of our children’s futures and shape their personalities, goals, behaviour, and way of thinking.  Teachers, like doctors, cannot afford to make mistakes, and the state authorities must therefore do everything possible to enable teachers to concentrate fully on their work and give them every opportunity they need to realise their potential and pass on to students not just their knowledge and skills but also, through their own examples, cultivate an honest and deeply conscientious approach to work. All of the finalists in the Teacher of the Year competition give us just such examples. I thank you all sincerely for your devoted spirit and high professionalism, and I wish you success, good health, and new achievements. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16583, 'place': 'The Kremlin, Moscow', 'title': 'Vladimir Putin presented awards to the winners of the national Teacher of the Year 2012 competition', 'teaser': 'In the run-up to Teachers’ Day, the President met with participants in the annual national Teacher of the Year competition.', 'tags': ['School'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, friends, I want to congratulate you all and your colleagues on your upcoming professional holiday – Teachers’ Day, which falls on October 5.

There are teachers of different generations among the finalists. Some are young and others have years of experience and have already set hundreds of school graduates on the road into adult life. This shows that our young teachers are gaining experience fast, and that our older teachers are keeping pace with the times and constantly honing their skills. I recall when I visited a school – I think I mentioned it publicly at the time – I saw a teacher, already of a venerable age, sitting at a computer and working on the internet. “Do you find it interesting?” I asked her. “It’s so interesting that I don’t want to retire,” she replied. That is a good sign.  Russia’s teaching profession was always distinguished by the way it combines innovative spirit with faithfulness to tradition. This tight intertwining of continuity and development is very important for our national education system and for preserving the best in our teaching and education traditions. Our schools should be open to all that is new – in fact, this has always been the case – and at the same time, they should preserve what makes them unique, preserve the roots and values that our society has developed over the centuries, and not just teach, but nurture and develop people and citizens. I believe this is the approach that should underlie and shape our state education policy. We will develop this policy together, through direct dialogue with the teaching community, with you, friends. Teachers are set to play a bigger part in schools’ lives and in organising the teaching process. Training and professional development for teachers and a new wage payment system designed to encourage quality and conscientious work are all top priorities for developing our schools.  Our task is to give teachers working and living conditions worthy of their noble mission and to give the teaching profession greater prestige. It is after all a tremendous responsibility to teach and educate our children and devote one’s efforts to our schools, which lay the foundations of our children’s futures and shape their personalities, goals, behaviour, and way of thinking.  Teachers, like doctors, cannot afford to make mistakes, and the state authorities must therefore do everything possible to enable teachers to concentrate fully on their work and give them every opportunity they need to realise their potential and pass on to students not just their knowledge and skills but also, through their own examples, cultivate an honest and deeply conscientious approach to work. All of the finalists in the Teacher of the Year competition give us just such examples. I thank you all sincerely for your devoted spirit and high professionalism, and I wish you success, good health, and new achievements. <…>', 'wordlist': ['good', 'afternoon', ',', 'friend', ',', 'I',

Today we witnessed the final phase of the project. As you know, Ulyanovsk Aviation Plant was one of the youngest enterprises in the Soviet time: it had barely began operating in the late 1980s — early 1990s when it closed down again. Attempts were made to organise the production of buses and some other things, and in 2003 the plant employed 1,500 people, most of whom were engaged mainly in protecting the industrial facilities and the territory. It was around 2005 when we focused our efforts on the plant and the question arose if it was possible to create here a new Russian transport aircraft on the basis of IL-76. Long negotiations ensued with our friends and partners in Uzbekistan since the aircraft’s final assembly was done at the Tashkent plant in the Soviet period, but unfortunately, we did not reach agreement for economic reasons and made the final decision to launch production at the Ulyanovsk plant. Practical work began in 2006 but it took us six years to get the new plane up in the air. Once again, I congratulate all of you, both the veteran workers, and the plant already has such employees, and young professionals who joined the company in recent years. What we saw here today, the event we all witnessed was more than just the flight of a newly restored aircraft. Over 70% of IL-76 has been modernised, and the result is essentially a new aircraft with a qualitatively higher performance, reliability, range, cost effectiveness and cargo capacity, which has increased by 20 tons. I want to emphasise that there is a truly great demand for IL-476. We started negotiations six years ago with our partners in some Asian countries, including China. I think they were ready to buy 38 – up to 50 aircraft. I am sure that there will be great demand for this aircraft in our country and abroad. The plant will get a solid list of orders, which is why we have invited not only Government members here today, not only technology manufacturers, but also all potential customers. I am confident that our foreign partners will show an interest in this aircraft. Our key customers will include the Russian Armed Forces, state agencies and local aircraft companies. We agreed that a contract is to be signed today on the purchase of 39 aircraft by the Defence Ministry for a total of almost 140 billion rubles. I want to note that this is the largest order in the Russian aviation industry in all of its short history. This is the first new aircraft the Russian aviation industry has produced in the past 21 years. I congratulate you once again and ask you to sign the contract I have just mentioned. Signing of contract. Vladimir Putin: [Defence Minister] Mr Serdyukov demonstrated a good example to all potential clients. I hope our colleagues present here will also follow this example. I will address the subject in more detail. Of course, we have some major, serious work ahead to fulfil the signed contract, and I expect it will be duly and timely implemented, therefore particular attention must be given to resolving all issues concerning the launch of the serial production of the new aircraft which requires staff and production facilities to be ready for such production. For our part, we will provide the necessary assistance to the Finance Ministry and the Defence Ministry. Instructions will be given to ensure issue of state guarantees to the enterprise for undertaking serial deliveries of the Il-476 airplane. No doubt, a key challenge is the thorough modernisation of the entire aviation industry, both civil and military which includes personnel training, renewing testing and manufacturing infrastructure, developing the full chain of auxiliary production facilities to manufacture hardware components and prospective materials, including composites. This is why it is so important for the enormous resources we are channelling toward the armament programme and the development of the military-industrial complex in Russia to have a cumulative, systemic effect, allowing us to create a truly global, competitive aviation industry. You all know quite well that the competition in this sector, in global aviation, is very fierce. But so far, there is in fact no one aside from ourselves and our American partners who is producing such aircraft. The Europeans are planning to build an aircraft that seems to be essentially based on the An-70, but its loadbearing capacity will be 20 tonnes less. Still, they have not produced it yet; they are just planning to do so. And so, there is currently no one aside from Russia and the US building such planes. Russia must certainly maintain a strong aviation sector overall. This is required to guarantee our security and our technological sovereignty. I repeat: in equipping our Armed Forces and other state agencies, we will rely primarily on Russian manufacturers. This summer, we had detailed discussions on issues of organising deliveries of new military aviation technology to the army and navy. Today, we will talk about designing the state order for civil and specialised aircraft which will meet the needs of the Defence Ministry, Emergencies Ministry, Interior Ministry, the FSB, and other agencies and ministries. Such aircraft include transport, medical and fire-fighting aviation, airplanes that are used in emergencies for cargo transportation, humanitarian assistance, transporting wounded and sick individuals. Currently, a significant proportion of the existing fleet of these airplanes is outdated morally, technologically and physically. By 2018, overall, we will have to retire some 80 aircraft. So now, we are to carefully plan the programme for renewing our air fleet, with an eye toward the future: what airplanes, of what class and in what quantity the country will need. We should put together a common – I want to stress this – a common, consolidated state procurement order for Russian-made civil and transportation aircraft. And we must take this approach, because we fully understand that if we do not have such a consolidated order, it will be practically impossible for companies to launch production to the fullest extent; it will be impossible to ever build things serially – the financial factors won’t allow it. They require a stable order for several years. It is precisely that approach which will allow for companies to be engaged in rhythmic, efficient work and have the opportunity to plan long-term technological development programmes and cut costs. <…>\", 'kremlin_id': 16596, 'place': 'Ulyanovsk Region', 'title': 'Meeting on the state order for Russian-made aircraft', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin held a meeting on including Russian-made civil and transport aircraft in the consolidated state order until 2020.', 'tags': ['Industry'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, colleagues, friends, I have every reason to thank and congratulate the chief designer, plant director and the entire team who worked hard to achieve this stage in the creation of a new Russian transport aircraft.

This official visit by the Russian President is taking place as we mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. Our talks took place in a friendly atmosphere of complete understanding and gave us the chance to take an in-depth look at the full spectrum of our relations and exchange views on their future development prospects. The results of the talks are set out in the joint political statement we have approved. This document also outlines the measures we will take to develop key bilateral cooperation areas over the coming period and our cooperation policy on the international stage. What I particularly want to stress is that our relations and cooperation are growing, and we want to continue deepening these ties in all different areas. We expressed a mutual desire to strengthen our political contacts. Economic cooperation and comprehensive development of our economic ties were at the heart of today’s talks. We agreed to intensify our common efforts to develop the economic side of our relations and put it on the level of our military and political partnership. We also expressed mutual interest in expanding our mutually advantageous cooperation in hydroelectricity. In this context, both sides spoke in favour of constructive solutions to the region’s pressing hydroelectricity and water use issues.  In this respect, we think it necessary to highlight once more that, in accordance with the UN Charter and other international legal provisions, Tajikistan has the right to use its natural resources, including its hydro-energy resources, for the good of its people. But this does not mean that in developing our hydroelectricity sector we will pursue only our own interests. In setting its policy, Tajikistan always follows the principle of finding a reasonable balance between national and regional interests. This is the main imperative underlying our actions and we will continue this policy in the future.  In this context, we have repeatedly put forward regional and global water initiatives, the logical continuation of which we see in the UN General Assembly’s decision to declare 2013 the International Year of Water Cooperation. We hope that 2013 will become a real opportunity for constructive and open dialogue on current water issues at all levels. As far as other issues on our agenda go, in the area of increasing social and legal protection for labour migrants we agreed to find rapid positive solutions and extend the deadlines for labour migrants’ registration and the validity of their work permits.  We also agreed that Russia will deliver oil products to Tajikistan for our domestic consumption needs without imposing export duties. As part of our ongoing cooperation against global threats and challenges, we agreed to intensify the fight against drug trafficking and signed an agreement in this area. We thank Russia for the financial assistance it provides to our drug control agency’s work. We gave close attention to the issue of making fuller use of our opportunities for developing cultural and humanitarian ties. We have made progress in developing our military and military technical cooperation too. We share the view that close cooperation in these areas is in our strategic interests and strengthens stability and security in the region. We have signed a new package of agreements in this area, including an agreement on the status and terms applying to the Russian military base on Tajikistan’s soil. In accordance with this agreement, Russia will modernise and technically upgrade Tajikistan’s armed forces and provide them with modern weapons. Russia will also help to provide training for service personnel and assist in other areas of strengthening Tajikistan’s defence capability.  We exchanged views on a wide range of current regional and international issues, including Afghanistan. We share the view on the need to get Afghanistan actively involved in regional cooperation. We noted that this will help to mitigate the social and economic consequences of the new transition period that Afghanistan is going through in its national development. We noted our common and similar views on all of the regional and global issues. In conclusion, I express my great satisfaction with today’s talks. I am sure that this official visit by the President of Russia, our friend, will open a new page in the rich history of our countries’ relations. It is with great pleasure that I now give the floor to my colleague, the President of the Russian Federation. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much. Mr President, friends, ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I want to congratulate the President of Tajikistan on his birthday and wish him good health, well-being, and success in his important state work. The President of Tajikistan, Mr Rahmon, can take a lot of credit for the high level of interstate relations and the strategic partnership and cooperation that we have. He has done much to strengthen our ties and continues his efforts in this direction. We see the results in the agreements signed just before. I will speak about them in more detail, adding to what President Rahmon has already said. ”Tajikistan is an active supporter of deepening the integration process in the CIS   Background information Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)    in general, and we greatly value and support Tajikistan’s efforts in this area. ” Tajikistan is an active supporter of deepening the integration process in the CIS   Background information Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)    in general, and we greatly value and support Tajikistan’s efforts in this area.  Let me say a few words about our talks today. They took place in a very friendly, frank and business-like atmosphere. We discussed in detail a broad range of topical issues related to our political dialogue, trade and economic ties, defence and security cooperation, and humanitarian matters. You saw that we just signed a solid package of agreements, and I am sure their implementation will give our bilateral cooperation a big boost.  Key among these documents is the agreement setting the terms for Russia’s stationing of its military base on Tajikistan’s soil for the next 30 years – until 2042. This step will guarantee reliable protection for our strategic interests and will strengthen security and stability throughout the Central Asian region. In the area of jointly fighting drug trafficking we agreed to allocate more than $5 million to Tajikistan’s Presidential Drugs Control Agency. We will continue to help Tajikistan train drugs control personnel at Russia’s training facilities. This work is already in process and will continue, indeed, it will become more specifically targeted in nature and more effective.  We gave priority attention to business cooperation opportunities. As I said at the expanded-format talks earlier, we cannot be satisfied with the current trade figures of $810 million in 2011 and $413 million for the first half of 2012. This level of trade is not high enough for what our two countries could achieve.  The investment situation is a bit brighter. Total Russian investment in Tajikistan now comes to $1.2 billion. In 2011, our companies invested more than $133 million in Tajikistan — $133.6 million to be precise. The Intergovernmental Commission will play an active part in making our economic cooperation more effective and creating a favourable environment for expanding mutually advantageous contacts. To this end we recently raised the level of the commission’s co-chairman on the Russian side.  We see good opportunities for intensifying our industrial cooperation. Over the last three years we have established 15 new joint ventures. There are now 125 joint ventures at work here, working in all different sectors, from construction and retail to producing furniture and textiles. Tajikistan is rich in raw materials and hydro-energy resources. The focus of our cooperation is making maximum effective use of this potential for Tajikistan’s economic and social development. Good developments have already been made. As you know, Sangtudin Hydroelectric Power Station 1 has already been built and brought on line and now produces 15 percent of the country’s electricity. Gazprom-Zarubezhneftegaz is carrying gas deposit exploration work, and Gazpromneft-Tajikistan is building a service station network in the country and is one of Tajikistan’s biggest taxpayers, contributing 2.2 percent of the budget’s revenue.  We are examining possibilities for carrying out projects to build medium and small-capacity power stations on Tajikistan’s internal rivers. President Rahmon raised this issue today and during his visit to Moscow too. We are examining the possibilities and think the idea is perfectly feasible. The latest example of our efforts to strengthen Tajikistan’s energy sector is the memorandum on duty-free deliveries of oil products that we signed today. We think this will be of direct support to Tajikistan’s economy.  We reached agreements on continued cooperation in migration policy. There are currently 1.3 million Tajikistani citizens working in Russia. We plan to extend the deadline for migrants’ registration to 15 days and issue work permits for up to three-year periods. Our position is that these decisions will have a positive effect on our market for foreign labour, help to stabilise labour migrants’ situation, and give Tajikistani citizens the opportunity to build their plans on a more solid and legal basis.  I note that remittances from labour migrants support the welfare of a large part of Tajikistan’s population. Labour migrants sent home almost $3 billion in 2011 – almost half of Tajikistan’s GDP. Our cultural, scientific, and education contacts have become more active too. Moscow State University and the MISiS National Research and Technology University have opened branches in Dushanbe. The Moscow Energy Institute will open a branch soon. Incidentally, we discussed today the need for Russian language studies in schools. This will certainly help Tajikistan’s economy to develop based on its own resources, with our participation, and the participation of other foreign partners too. It will help to create new highly-skilled and decently paid jobs. I think that some of the migration issues would not be as serious also if we work in this direction.  There are currently 4,700 students from Tajikistan studying in Russian universities. We would like to see broader Russian language studies in Tajikistan, including at the Russian-Tajikistani (Slavic) University, as I mentioned earlier, which has become an education leader in Tajikistan and now has 4,300 students. I think that knowledge of Russian would considerably expand Tajikistanis’ professional opportunities, especially in the case of young people, and help them to move more freely in the Russian and CIS information space and get education and better skilled jobs. During our talks we discussed cooperation in the CIS   Background information Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)   , the Collective Security Treaty Organisation   Background information Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO)   , the Eurasian Economic Community   Background information Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC)   , and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation   Background information Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)   . I am sure that close coordination in international and integration affairs, including within the integration organisations, is in the interests of both countries and peoples and will bolster stability throughout Central Asia.  In conclusion, I want to thank the President of Tajikistan and all of our colleagues for the very business-like and warm atmosphere they created today and for our work together.

Mr President, friends, ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I want to congratulate the President of Tajikistan on his birthday and wish him good health, well-being, and success in his important state work. The President of Tajikistan, Mr Rahmon, can take a lot of credit for the high level of interstate relations and the strategic partnership and cooperation that we have. He has done much to strengthen our ties and continues his efforts in this direction. We see the results in the agreements signed just before. I will speak about them in more detail, adding to what President Rahmon has already said. ”Tajikistan is an active supporter of deepening the integration process in the CIS   Background information Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)    in general, and we greatly value and support Tajikistan’s efforts in this area. ” Tajikistan is an active supporter of deepening the integration process in the CIS   Background information Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)    in general, and we greatly value and support Tajikistan’s efforts in this area.  Let me say a few words about our talks today. They took place in a very friendly, frank and business-like atmosphere. We discussed in detail a broad range of topical issues related to our political dialogue, trade and economic ties, defence and security cooperation, and humanitarian matters. You saw that we just signed a solid package of agreements, and I am sure their implementation will give our bilateral cooperation a big boost.  Key among these documents is the agreement setting the terms for Russia’s stationing of its military base on Tajikistan’s soil for the next 30 years – until 2042. This step will guarantee reliable protection for our strategic interests and will strengthen security and stability throughout the Central Asian region. In the area of jointly fighting drug trafficking we agreed to allocate more than $5 million to Tajikistan’s Presidential Drugs Control Agency. We will continue to help Tajikistan train drugs control personnel at Russia’s training facilities. This work is already in process and will continue, indeed, it will become more specifically targeted in nature and more effective.  We gave priority attention to business cooperation opportunities. As I said at the expanded-format talks earlier, we cannot be satisfied with the current trade figures of $810 million in 2011 and $413 million for the first half of 2012. This level of trade is not high enough for what our two countries could achieve.  The investment situation is a bit brighter. Total Russian investment in Tajikistan now comes to $1.2 billion. In 2011, our companies invested more than $133 million in Tajikistan — $133.6 million to be precise. The Intergovernmental Commission will play an active part in making our economic cooperation more effective and creating a favourable environment for expanding mutually advantageous contacts. To this end we recently raised the level of the commission’s co-chairman on the Russian side.  We see good opportunities for intensifying our industrial cooperation. Over the last three years we have established 15 new joint ventures. There are now 125 joint ventures at work here, working in all different sectors, from construction and retail to producing furniture and textiles. Tajikistan is rich in raw materials and hydro-energy resources. The focus of our cooperation is making maximum effective use of this potential for Tajikistan’s economic and social development. Good developments have already been made. As you know, Sangtudin Hydroelectric Power Station 1 has already been built and brought on line and now produces 15 percent of the country’s electricity. Gazprom-Zarubezhneftegaz is carrying gas deposit exploration work, and Gazpromneft-Tajikistan is building a service station network in the country and is one of Tajikistan’s biggest taxpayers, contributing 2.2 percent of the budget’s revenue.  We are examining possibilities for carrying out projects to build medium and small-capacity power stations on Tajikistan’s internal rivers. President Rahmon raised this issue today and during his visit to Moscow too. We are examining the possibilities and think the idea is perfectly feasible. The latest example of our efforts to strengthen Tajikistan’s energy sector is the memorandum on duty-free deliveries of oil products that we signed today. We think this will be of direct support to Tajikistan’s economy.  We reached agreements on continued cooperation in migration policy. There are currently 1.3 million Tajikistani citizens working in Russia. We plan to extend the deadline for migrants’ registration to 15 days and issue work permits for up to three-year periods.

Mr Putin fixed the decoration to the base’s battle flag. The President also announced that Russia and Tajikistan have signed an agreement extending Russia’s lease on the base until 2042. * * * Excerpts from meeting with service members at 201st Russian Military Base President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, friends, good afternoon, First of all, I would like to congratulate your entire unit, your entire base, on receiving this state decoration. Second, I want to let you know that today, the President and I attended the signing of an agreement that will serve as a good legal foundation for the normal operation and development of a Russian military base in Tajikistan. It will be effective through 2042, for 30 years. Your military unit is known for its combat traditions. Your division which is now the 201st Military Base participated very actively in combat near Leningrad during the Great Patriotic War, then defended the interests of our country in Afghanistan and had a serious influence in stabilising the situation in Tajikistan, where you are located today. This is a major, serious military history. And today, here in Tajikistan, you are at the forefront of pursuing various combat, military and political tasks. The Russian Military Base in Tajikistan is one of the most important factors of stability in the republic – a republic with which we are linked through special brotherly, close strategic relations; a republic that serves as an outpost for the entire Commonwealth of Independent States in this area, in the very complex and significant field of relations with Afghanistan. There is no need to explain to you how important this is for Tajikistan, for all of Central Asia, and for Russia as well. I am certain you will duly accomplish the tasks you are charged with, commendably pursuing this honourable mission and increasing your combat readiness. I very much expect that, as has been the case lately, you will maintain good relationships with local residents who welcome the presence of Russian military in Tajikistan. We must value such attitude since it is a very important factor for proper function of the Russian Military Base in Tajikistan. I want to reiterate again that along with our base in Kant, Kyrgyzstan, the 201st Russian Military Base in Tajikistan fulfils an important mission of protecting Russia’s interests. I want to thank the President of Tajikistan and all the Tajikistani people for today’s decision to extend the lease on the military base for 30 more years. I should stress that the Russian Federation, the Russian leadership, and the Russian state will always be highly attentive to your mission, needs, logistical situation, armament and resolution of social issues. Congratulations once again on your award. I will now pass the floor to my friend and colleague, the President of Tajikistan. Mr Rahmon, if you please. President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon: Thank you very much, Mr Putin. Comrade officers of the Russian Armed Forces, friends, First of all, it is a great pleasure to once again welcome President of Russia Mr Putin to Tajikistan in your presence, this time as the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Federation’s Armed Forces. The decision we made together, Mr President, following today’s talks, has great significance for the continued development of our strategic partnership, including its military and technical component. We perceive our cooperation with Russia in these areas as the major foundation for strengthening our defence capabilities, as a factor for ensuring regional stability. The location of the 201st Military Base in Tajikistan also serves Russia’s interests, including their geopolitical aspect. Having signed a package of documents on military and military-technical cooperation, including the agreement regarding the 201st Russian Military Base, we have confirmed our mutual desire to take our relations in the field of security to a qualitatively new stage of development. I have no doubt that implementing these agreements will make our mutually beneficial cooperation in this area more active, diverse and effective. Given the reality of today’s situation, this is a critically important joint step. I don’t think there is any need to talk in detail about the scope of threats posed by international terrorism, extremism, drug trafficking and other forms of transnational organised crime. Events throughout the world clearly demonstrate that global security problems can only be resolved through joint efforts. Our armed forces must safeguard our freedoms, the territorial integrity of our country and the safety of our people. Therefore, they must constantly improve their combat training, in order to be ready at any minute to defend these sacred concepts. In this regard, Tajikistan and the Russian Federation have acquired vast positive cooperation experience. I would like to particularly note the role and place of the predecessor of the Russian Military Base, the 201st Gatchina Twice-Red Banner Motorised Infantry Division. As the core of the CIS’ collective peacekeeping forces, it made an enormous input into establishing peace and strengthening stability in Tajikistan. I am certain that you – the commanders and servicemen of the 201st Russian Military Base – will duly follow the mission of your predecessors, making your own input into the process of developing relations of friendship and multifaceted cooperation between our countries and our peoples. Receiving the Russian state decoration you have earned today, which will decorate your military banner henceforth, once again confirms the truth of my words and the high assessment of your military service by the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Federation’s Armed Forces. I wish all of you valiant warriors of Russia many more successes in your combat training, new achievements in protecting our common interests and strengthening military cooperation and strategic partnership between the Republic of Tajikistan and the Russian Federation. Thank you very much. Congratulations once again. <…> Vladimir Putin: I believe that NATO, which was formed during the Cold War, has long-ago lost its primary function and it is unclear why it exists today. There is no more confrontation between two political systems since there are no two systems any longer and no Warsaw Pact, which one way or another was NATO’s rival. So it is unclear why NATO exists to this day. I think it is largely a throwback to the Cold War. But the existence of this military bloc is a geopolitical reality which we must take into account. To a certain extent, under particular conditions, it can play a positive role when it acts under the resolutions of the United Nations, the UN Security Council. Based on the realities of international relations, we are prepared to build normal relations of partnership with this organisation. We have a NATO-Russia Council. Some of our challenges are certainly common, and Mr Rahmon also noted this, not in connection with NATO, but he talked about how there are problems that can only be resolved collectively, together. For example, the fight against drug trafficking, international organised crime, piracy and, I would add, terrorism and extremism. In many of these areas, we are building good relations with NATO member-states and the organisation as a whole. We would like, at minimum, for NATO not to overstep the bounds of its declared purposes, not to broaden its sphere of activity beyond the parameters set by the documents that define the scope of that activity, not to become a global organisation. We would like for it to transform more quickly (our partners from NATO say that they are supposedly transforming into more of a political organisation) – to more quickly transform into a purely political organisation. As for advancing its infrastructure – military infrastructure – closer to our borders, this of course has always caused us justified concern, and will continue to do so. I want to remind you that when East and West Germany were united, the former NATO Secretary General – I believe it was Chairman of the Federal Republic of Germany Mr Woerner that said at the time, “Russia can be certain of at least one thing: that NATO will not move toward its borders.” As we can see, life has turned out differently, and in practice, NATO’s military infrastructure is nearing our borders. As military servicemen, you fully understand that words are one thing, whereas the presence of missile strike systems or missile defence systems near our borders are another. And this generates real threats to our country. In such case, we will certainly need to design our defence policy such as to cut short these threats.

Second, I want to let you know that today, the President and I attended the signing of an agreement that will serve as a good legal foundation for the normal operation and development of a Russian military base in Tajikistan. It will be effective through 2042, for 30 years. Your military unit is known for its combat traditions. Your division which is now the 201st Military Base participated very actively in combat near Leningrad during the Great Patriotic War, then defended the interests of our country in Afghanistan and had a serious influence in stabilising the situation in Tajikistan, where you are located today. This is a major, serious military history. And today, here in Tajikistan, you are at the forefront of pursuing various combat, military and political tasks. The Russian Military Base in Tajikistan is one of the most important factors of stability in the republic – a republic with which we are linked through special brotherly, close strategic relations; a republic that serves as an outpost for the entire Commonwealth of Independent States in this area, in the very complex and significant field of relations with Afghanistan. There is no need to explain to you how important this is for Tajikistan, for all of Central Asia, and for Russia as well. I am certain you will duly accomplish the tasks you are charged with, commendably pursuing this honourable mission and increasing your combat readiness. I very much expect that, as has been the case lately, you will maintain good relationships with local residents who welcome the presence of Russian military in Tajikistan. We must value such attitude since it is a very important factor for proper function of the Russian Military Base in Tajikistan. I want to reiterate again that along with our base in Kant, Kyrgyzstan, the 201st Russian Military Base in Tajikistan fulfils an important mission of protecting Russia’s interests. I want to thank the President of Tajikistan and all the Tajikistani people for today’s decision to extend the lease on the military base for 30 more years. I should stress that the Russian Federation, the Russian leadership, and the Russian state will always be highly attentive to your mission, needs, logistical situation, armament and resolution of social issues. Congratulations once again on your award. I will now pass the floor to my friend and colleague, the President of Tajikistan. Mr Rahmon, if you please. I believe that NATO, which was formed during the Cold War, has long-ago lost its primary function and it is unclear why it exists today. There is no more confrontation between two political systems since there are no two systems any longer and no Warsaw Pact, which one way or another was NATO’s rival. So it is unclear why NATO exists to this day. I think it is largely a throwback to the Cold War. But the existence of this military bloc is a geopolitical reality which we must take into account. To a certain extent, under particular conditions, it can play a positive role when it acts under the resolutions of the United Nations, the UN Security Council. Based on the realities of international relations, we are prepared to build normal relations of partnership with this organisation. We have a NATO-Russia Council. Some of our challenges are certainly common, and Mr Rahmon also noted this, not in connection with NATO, but he talked about how there are problems that can only be resolved collectively, together. For example, the fight against drug trafficking, international organised crime, piracy and, I would add, terrorism and extremism. In many of these areas, we are building good relations with NATO member-states and the organisation as a whole. We would like, at minimum, for NATO not to overstep the bounds of its declared purposes, not to broaden its sphere of activity beyond the parameters set by the documents that define the scope of that activity, not to become a global organisation. We would like for it to transform more quickly (our partners from NATO say that they are supposedly transforming into more of a political organisation) – to more quickly transform into a purely political organisation. As for advancing its infrastructure – military infrastructure – closer to our borders, this of course has always caused us justified concern, and will continue to do so. I want to remind you that when East and West Germany were united, the former NATO Secretary General – I believe it was Chairman of the Federal Republic of Germany Mr Woerner that said at the time, “Russia can be certain of at least one thing: that NATO will not move toward its borders.” As we can see, life has turned out differently, and in practice, NATO’s military infrastructure is nearing our borders. As military servicemen, you fully understand that words are one thing, whereas the presence of missile strike systems or missile defence systems near our borders are another. And this generates real threats to our country. In such case, we will certainly need to design our defence policy such as to cut short these threats. That is how we intend to proceed. <…>', 'wordlist': ['comrade', 'officer', ',', 'friend', ',', 'good', 'afternoon', ',', 'first', 'of', 'all', ',', 'I', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'congratulate', 'your',

            "{'date': '2012-10-08T12:40:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': '* * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sokolov, there are several questions I want to discuss. The first is passenger traffic from the Far East. You recall that during one of our trips to the region, local women said they do not think it very fair that women are entitled to discount ticket prices only from age 60 onwards – the same as men – even though women retire earlier. We agreed then to fix this matter. What is the situation now?  Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov     Sokolov Maxim : Yes, Mr President, the Government has already approved changes to the categories of passengers benefiting from discount prices for travel between the Far East and Siberia and European Russia. Women who have reached retirement age – starting from 55 – are now entitled to these discounts.  Vladimir Putin: So their entitlement now starts at 55, not at 60. Maxim Sokolov: That’s right. The discounts also apply to people with category 1 disabilities and the people accompanying them, and also passengers accompanying disabled children. An additional 400 million rubles was allocated this summer to finance this programme. Vladimir Putin: Is there enough money to finance all of this subsidised travel? Maxim Sokolov: We already see now that there is such demand for this travel that around 450,000 tickets worth a total of around 3 billion have already been sold. There was a shortfall of 100 million rubles to finance all of the subsidised tickets. The Transport Ministry made up the shortfall from its own budget, without having to increase the budget’s overall funding this year, and the money was used to meet the demand from all of the entitled passengers.  Vladimir Putin: In other words, the programme will be carried out in full. Maxim Sokolov: Yes. All those entitled will be guaranteed subsidised travel to and from the Far East. Vladimir Putin: Excellent. That is a long-distance travel issue settled. Another issue that people often raise, however, is that of local travel, and this problem has persisted for a number of years now. We know there are many problems involved here. What is the Ministry doing now to resolve the situation?  Maxim Sokolov: Developing regional traffic is one of the Ministry’s top priorities. Starting next year, our budget allocates an additional 5 billion rubles annually to develop regional traffic. Of this amount, 3.5 billion will support the subsidies I mentioned before, and we will carry out another programme with funding of almost 3 billion rubles to subsidise travel within regions. This will concern primarily regions in the Far East, Urals, Siberian, and Northwest federal districts, where air travel is often the only option for getting from one place to another.  This programme will target specifically not the main route carriers but regional carriers providing local travel services, and as I said, 3 billion rubles has been earmarked for this. Aside from this, we are starting a pilot project next year in the Volga Federal District. The plan here is to increase five-fold the amount of regional traffic within the federal district based on co-financing from all of the district’s regions. If the project proves a success we will launch similar programmes the following year in the Northwest, Southern, and North Caucasus federal districts, where they are already being drafted. Vladimir Putin: You need to work more closely with the Industry Ministry so as to acquire Russian-made goods. The Ministry needs to coordinate its needs with our manufacturers so that our foreign partners who have been supplying their goods so far know in advance what kind of timeframe they will have ahead in order to shift production here, for example, just as happened in the automotive sector, and you need to coordinate things so that our own aircraft manufacturers can develop production accordingly. Maxim Sokolov: Mr President, the objective is clear. We are indeed working together with the Industry and Trade Ministry. We have subsidised leasing programmes for regional aircraft. We are currently working with the Industry and Trade Ministry on drafting proposals that will give priority use of these subsidies to Russian aircraft or to aircraft assembled on Russian territory. Vladimir Putin: With a high degree of local production. Maxim Sokolov: Yes, understood, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: In other words, we do not need simple assembly of foreign-made parts, but localised production. Simple assembly operations can go ahead, but only in the short term. Maxim Sokolov: Yes, this is not something that can all just take place overnight. Vladimir Putin: It is essential to move in this direction, essential that everyone makes this change and not come to rely on constant supplies from abroad. Understood? Maxim Sokolov: Yes. Vladimir Putin: When will you and [Minister of Trade and Industry] Manturov report in detail on this matter? Maxim Sokolov: I think we will be able to do so within a month. We are already working on it and will be ready to report on the actual programmes and projects that our companies are carrying out. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16610, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Working meeting with Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov', 'teaser': 'Subsidised passenger traffic to and from the Russian Far East and developing regional air traffic were the main subjects of discussion.', 'tags': ['Regions', 'Transport'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Mr Sokolov, there are several questions I want to discuss.

The window on the market opened for almost two days and, thanks to the Central Bank and Government’s joint effort, we were able to make the most of the opportunity. The corridor we were working within was based on a target of 5.2 billion at a price of 93 rubles per share. This is higher than the share price for the previous placement (89 rubles per share). This is the biggest privatisation deal in Russian history. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: You’re referring to the sale of 7,6 percent of our shares? German Gref: Yes, that’s right. Vladimir Putin: For every $100 invested 10 years ago, you have now made $3,700, as far as I know. German Gref: Yes, that’s right. We are second after Apple in terms of yield for the last decade. Overall, I think this is a very good deal for Russia and it got good publicity everywhere. Despite the big fall following the placement, we are holding stable at around 92 rubles per share. We still have a tough time ahead while adapting to the big number of shares now on the market, but we nonetheless forecast growth. Our fundamental indicators are all in good shape and we expect stable growth through the rest of this year. We will meet in full our obligations to investors. Vladimir Putin: Good. How did things go in Turkey? German Gref: That was difficult work. Unfortunately, we had only a short time and faced stiff competition for this Turkish bank [DenizBank]. We and the National Bank of Qatar were the final contenders in the race to buy what is Turkey’s sixth-biggest bank. The bank is a good and very modern asset. It was being sold off by Belgian bank Dexia, one of Europe’s biggest banks. Dexia did not actually want to sell the bank at all, but had to at the regulator’s request.  The sales price was 1.3 percent of the capital value, around 2.7 billion euros. By the end of the year, depending on the actual results at the moment of sale, we will have to pay an additional sum in line with the change in net assets’ value, in other words, the bank’s profit over the course of this year. This will add on around 170 million euros. Overall then, the acquisition cost comes to around 3 billion euros, that is, approximately $4 billion.  This is Sberbank’s biggest foreign acquisition ever, and it is a high-quality asset. The bank will make around $400 million in net profit this year on the Turkish market, and next year’s forecast is for net profit of $600 million. The acquisition gives us a good platform because in addition to being on the Turkish market, the bank is also present in five other countries, thus offering us a good platform for working in Asia. It has a good team and well-organised operations and product range. The bank is Turkey’s second-biggest lender in the agriculture sector, and we hope to obtain a good multiplying effect through our work with this asset. We can transfer some of our modern methods there, and there is a lot that we can transfer from there to Russia, especially as regards operations in the agriculture sector and work with small and medium-sized enterprises.  The regulators have all reacted very positively to us. After the acquisition, the Turkish regulator lowered our capital adequacy ratio from 15 to 12 percent, which frees up capital for us. We will be able to steadily develop the bank for a number of years ahead now without having to inject more capital. I think the acquisition will help us to build an excellent bridge between our two economies. Turkey has big growth potential and we are Turkey’s second-biggest trading partner today, and first in terms of the rate at which our trade is growing. Vladimir Putin: Turkish companies are very active and if the bank can service them and service the respective trade turnover, it will only benefit. German Gref: Added to this, Mr President, is the fact that 1,400 Russian companies are working on the Turkish market now, including our strategic partner Rosatom, which has made huge investment in building a nuclear power plant.  Vladimir Putin: Yes, this is a big project. German Gref: I think we will be able to develop the business over the next few years and create a good bridge for Russian companies working on the Turkish market. Vladimir Putin: How has Sberbank been performing on the domestic market over the last 6 months? German Gref: Mr President, we summed up the results of the last 8 months. Our interest income over this period has increased by 26 percent compared to the same period last year. Our net profit for eight months comes to 239 billion rubles. Vladimir Putin: How does that compare to the same period last year? German Gref: It is around 8–10 percent higher than last year. We think that we can increase this profit further by the end of the year compared to last year’s result. This year has not seen the kind of drawing on reserves that we made use of last year, but we have produced stable financial results, earning around 27–29 billion rubles a month, and we expect to keep up this pace through to the end of the year. Vladimir Putin: Which CIS   Background information Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)    countries do you work in? German Gref: We are present in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. We have decided for now to limit our investments to these three countries. We work in 20 different countries and do not intend to increase this number over the next three years. Over these next three years we need to build ourselves a strong international platform. This is a new experience for us and not an easy undertaking by any means. We bought a problematic asset in Eastern Europe. We got it on the cheap, but it is a loss-making asset and over the next three years we have to turn it around and get it profitable.  Vladimir Putin: Whereabouts in Eastern Europe? German Gref: The Czech Republic, Serbia, Slovenia, Slovakia, eight Central European countries in total, except for Poland, which is a market we are interested in. We have gained a presence in all the Central European countries except Poland, but we will probably start looking at the Polish market after we finish developing our international platform.  <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16611, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting with Sberbank CEO German Gref', 'teaser': \"Mr Gref briefed the President on the bank's performance this year.\", 'tags': ['Banks'], 'transcript_filtered': 'You’re referring to the sale of 7,6 percent of our shares?

In particular, the issues discussed included the designation of different forms of land ownership, the use of land, the need for a common information resource about land, the terms for granting land plots under ownership or under leases, and the use of land for housing construction. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, We have gathered today to discuss ways to improve land use. As you know, it is a powerful factor in economic and social development, and at the same time one of the most complex and historically acute problems everywhere in the world, and in our country in particular. We must admit that our land potential is still managed ineffectively. Reforms of this sector are proceeding very slowly and laboriously. The situation has gradually begun to change only in the past six or seven years. This is a great challenge for our country because Russia has never had private ownership of land, or only for a very brief period and even then in a limited form. Today there is great demand for land in our country. More and more people are interesting in purchasing land to build homes or do business. However, both companies and individuals are constantly faced with an unreasonable amount of red tape. The President and the Government of the Russian Federation are bombarded with letters on this issue from all across the country. People write that it is impossible to find information on available land, that they are in a position of powerless petitioners whose demands and needs are ignored, and that it takes three or more years to get a plot of land. As a result, land remains unused and is not working for anyone’s benefit. The high-handedness and corruption of officials greatly inhibit the full-fledged development of land relations in Russia. And as a result, this slows the progress of the country as a whole. It is abundantly clear that there is need for additional measures to remove the barriers that prevent people from obtaining and using land plots freely and without red tape. That's why we have included this issue in the agenda of the State Council Presidium meeting. I think this is one of our first attempts to resolve issues in this area. We need to work through all the aspects properly, and I will tell you why: we have (and I have already talked about this) a historic chance to resolve the housing problem once and for all. If not completely, which probably can’t be achieved anywhere in the world, then we can radically improve the situation, but we will never be able to succeed without addressing the land issue. The Presidium Working Group has reviewed the application of land legislation in practice. The report that has been submitted analyses the main aspects in detail, and we will discuss them today. The first issue is the designation of different forms of land ownership. There is still a great deal of confusion because the process of identifying areas to be reserved for state needs and designated for use by the federal government remains unfinished. A large amount of land is simply left idle. We are not rich enough to keep so much land in reserve for decades. Therefore, in respect of under-utilised land we must take action and demand a clear justification for the land from the agencies and organisations that have the use of millions of hectares. If the land is not working, let's give it on to other owners, including municipalities, which have a better understanding of local needs and are capable of deciding where to build a house and where to plant potatoes or to use the land in some other way for the benefit of the people and the country. Of course, the local authorities have the obligation to use the ‘one stop’ principle in their work and act only in people’s interests, and we must never create a situation where we move a problem from one level to another while changing nothing. The second issue we must analyse carefully is land categories. The principles of state policy on land use for 2012–2017 were adopted in March 2012; they provide for removing from legislation the principle of designating land categories based on its intended purpose. It is obvious that the current system is outdated and we need to create a new model of land use that will be transparent and convenient for businesses and individuals. There must be a clear understanding of what you can build and where, and what restrictions exist on the use of a site; it is also necessary to provide for the institutions that will be responsible for preserving the most valuable and protected reserves and farmland. I look forward to hearing your proposals on these issues today. The third area is the formation of a single information resource on land. Unfortunately, this information is currently not open to the public. Department heads, employees of various government bodies and all sorts of intermediaries swarming around them have virtually monopolised this information, and it is impossible to gain ownership of even abandoned plots without access to this information. The lack of information and transparency is the main cause of corruption, which literally permeates the land market. We must reverse this situation and provide every individual with the opportunity to find information about any available or used land plots. What is so secret about that? And if there is a secret, it must be justified. I know there are many so-called “secret” land plots, which stand idle for years and nothing goes on there at all. This problem will be partially solved with the implementation of the construction industry road map. I am open to further suggestions on the organisation of a single database on land and public access to it. Fourth, the terms of granting land plots under ownership or leasing schemes. Today they do not stand up to scrutiny in terms of the timeframe involved and the registration procedure. I have already mentioned this at the start of my address. It is clearly necessary to introduce as quickly as possible open tenders based on the applications from legal entities and individuals. Land Code already stipulates that it is the obligation of local authorities to hold such tenders, but this can be applied only to land plots that have been registered. However, a clear obligation to register a land plot has not been stipulated, and it is not always easy to allocate the funding for this purpose in the local budget. I have the impression that sometimes the funding is not allocated with the express purpose to preserve the status quo. All these obstacles have to be addressed, including at the legislative level. The fifth challenge is the use of land for housing construction, and I have already talked about this. Let me remind you that we have set an ambitious target for the next eight years: to provide affordable housing to 60% of Russian families in need. This means that we must greatly increase construction volumes, especially with regard to economy class housing. Currently the principle of infill development governs the allocation of land plots, especially in or near large cities, where there is a well-developed infrastructure in place. We will not solve the problem with this approach, so we need to move as quickly as possible to integrated development and strict planning regulations closely aligned with the engineering and social infrastructure. It is important for any area: for rural areas and suburban areas where there is great demand for low-rise construction. Let me remind you that land plots for housing construction allocated to large families must be provided with the necessary infrastructure, as we have agreed. People simply can’t get the money to pay for it. However, it is not done in all regions, and as a result, if there is no infrastructure, families are forced either to incur significant expenses, or to give up their hopes to own their own home. I ask all speakers to focus special attention to the integrated development of land; we will also talk about the experience of the Housing Construction Development Facilitation Fund. I stress that it is essential not only to allocate land but to make sure land plots are available in the areas where there is a demand for housing, land plots that people can use and companies can build profitable businesses. Colleagues, I have named only a limited number of areas that we need to discuss. This is not an exhaustive list of land issues that are currently considered to be the most acute and problematic. I believe that they will be at the focus of our discussions today and in the future. This meeting is intended to be our first attempt to address them and we will return to analyse them more closely on other occasions.

Following the meeting, the two presidents issued a joint statement. Later, Vladimir Putin and Nursultan Nazarbayev     Nazarbayev Nursultan  attended a gala concert at the Bolshoi Theatre. * * * Beginning of meeting with President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, we saw each other just recently at the Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum I am very pleased that you have accepted our invitation and come to Moscow to continue our discussions on developing our bilateral political, trade and economic ties, to address issues pertaining to further integration – deepening integration – not just between our countries but throughout the entire post-Soviet space overall. We will have an excellent opportunity today to mark the anniversaries of major events, and this evening, we will discuss all these issues in more detail in an informal setting. Welcome. President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev: Thank you, Mr President, for your invitation. I want to once again wish you a happy birthday. I wish you good health and hope you will be successful in carrying out all your plans for Russia. We are marking the 20th anniversaries of our diplomatic ties and our framework agreement on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance. At our discussion we came to realise that our relations serve as a model within the CIS. Questions of energy, space exploration, and our bilateral relations, as well as the Common Economic Space – this is just a short, brief list of our joint work and issues we are addressing. The fact that 3,000 businesses are operating in Russia with participation by Kazakhstani capital, as well as 1,700 enterprises in Kazakhstan with Russian capital, speaks for itself. So we want to renew this major conversation on all the issues we just discussed, adapting to current needs and moving forward toward creating the Common Economic Space between Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. This is our noble goal; we must resolve this matter properly, without rushing, in order to foster a true, integrated association, the best in the post-Soviet space. Thank you for your attentive attitude toward all the matters that come up between our countries. We discussed this in Pavlodar, and talked it over today. I think that our cooperation and alliance will continue developing in a positive direction. Vladimir Putin: You know, what makes me particularly happy is that both Kazakhstan and Russia are oil and gas producers, but the structure of our trade does not have very many mutual purchases and sales of these products traditionally key to our economies; and still, our trade is growing, having hit a record last year. Twenty plus billion dollars – ultimately, that is a very good indicator. It speaks to the fact that everything pertaining to integration is working very efficiently. Nursultan Nazarbayev: Twenty-five billion dollars in turnover, and we have already reached half that in the first six months of this year. After the creation of the Customs Union trade has been growing by 30 percent per year. This is excellent and hadn’t happened before. New companies are emerging and cooperation is increasing, including in the military and technical sector. So we are very grateful. In Pavlodar, we discussed the issue of innovative, scientific and technical collaboration. This is very major, modern cooperation. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16622, 'place': 'The Kremlin, Moscow', 'title': 'Meeting with President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin met with President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had arrived in Moscow on the President of Russia’s invitation.', 'tags': ['Foreign policy'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Mr President, we saw each other just recently at the Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum I am very pleased that you have accepted our invitation and come to Moscow to continue our discussions on developing our bilateral political, trade and economic ties, to address issues pertaining to further integration – deepening integration – not just between our countries but throughout the entire post-Soviet space overall.

            "{'date': '2012-10-10T09:05:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': '* * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Shoigu, you raised some of the issues facing the Moscow Region, including one issue that concerns not just Moscow Region itself but also Muscovites and people in the central Russian regions in general. This is the issue of Moscow Region’s forests. What is happening in this area now and what proposals do you have here? Moscow Region Governor Sergei Shoigu     Shoigu SergeiDefence Minister : Mr President, acting on your instruction, as from July 1, all Moscow Region forests were placed under the region’s supervision, and we have started working actively with the Federal Forestry Agency on cleaning up the forests and – most important — carrying out the culling needed to get them healthy again. Vladimir Putin: Why, what was the problem with them? Sergei Shoigu: There is an insect that destroys forests, mostly coniferous forests — fir trees. It has already spread to an extent that threatens the forests’ survival. This year, we had 34,000 hectares affected, and next year we forecast a figure of 47,000 hectares. The only way to treat forests that have reached this state is to carry out sanitary culling, but this too is no simple undertaking. We will announce a call to mobilise everyone with the needed equipment to cut and remove the affected trees over the coming month. This concerns the Defence Ministry and Energy Ministry, for example, which, following your instructions after the ice storms, bought this equipment in order to carry out this kind of culling. It also concerns the Emergencies Ministry and the regional authorities of course.  This is a big undertaking that will require a lot of hard work, but if we do not do it we will see the area of diseased forest double every year. Vladimir Putin: I am rather more concerned about the regeneration issue. Culling the diseased forests is necessary of course, and the affected area is huge, but what will you do to regenerate the forests? Sergei Shoigu: Mr President, we are in the process of setting up two big tree nurseries so as to regenerate the forests. Our first measure will be to plant new trees. We have also appealed to the Government here. There is a big federal tree nursery not far from the Moscow Ring Road. It covers an area of almost 300 hectares and has been working for many years now, but this year it got put on the list of assets up for privatisation. We therefore appealed to the Government and our appeal was supported. We hope now that this will be followed through and the nursery will continue its work. We will use it to develop and regenerate the region’s forests.  Vladimir Putin: What you are asking for is that the tree nursery remain in the Moscow Region’s hands? Sergei Shoigu: It is a federal asset at the moment, and we want it to be transferred to the Moscow Region’s ownership. We have also started developing aviation to work in forest protection and servicing agriculture sector needs, and this brings me to another request. Given that the Moscow Region town of Zhukovsky is an aviation sector centre with a number of production companies manufacturing experimental and serial production aircraft, we want to establish a small aircraft centre there so as to develop this segment of the industry. A number of projects have been drafted for reviving Russia’s small aircraft sector and increasing service life of existing aircraft to 7,000 hours. There is demand all around the country for this, and our region has an interest in these projects as they would make use of our research centres and technical specialists. Moscow Region has entire towns that were involved in developed aviation and space equipment and you know that we have the capability for carrying out these new projects. With your support we would like to establish a big centre that would provide the country with small aircraft and aircraft for the Far North, aircraft that can land on water or ice. The Soviet Union had such models and we need them still today for our medical and polar aviation and for the needs of Siberia and the Far East. Of course we hope to put the Moscow Region’s scientific and industrial potential to work here.

Vladimir Putin: We see how the new Iraq is getting back on its feet and developing, and we are very happy for your success. Nouri al-Maliki: Your Excellency, I thank you sincerely for your invitation and for the attention you give to developing our bilateral relations. This is indeed our second meeting now and it is with pleasure that I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your birthday. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Our bilateral trade at the moment is not at such a high level, unfortunately, but there are some very promising big joint projects we can carry out. Russian companies are expanding their activities in Iraq now. There are many big energy companies operating there now, not just Russian companies, but international giants too. I hope our companies will continue steadily expanding their activities, and we hope very much for your support, Mr Prime Minister. We are continuing our contacts in the humanitarian sphere too. I think we have around 150 students from Iraq currently studying at Russian universities. We could take big steps forward in military technical cooperation too. I am very pleased of course that you accepted our invitation to come here and that we have this opportunity to discuss the situation in the region in general. It is a great pleasure to see you and I wish you welcome, Mr Prime Minister. Nouri al-Maliki: Thank you. We have already had the chance to exchange views on opportunities for developing our bilateral relations with the Prime Minister [Dmitry Medvedev] and the Russian delegation. We agreed to set several priority cooperation areas and have the specific ministries draw up detailed plans. These sectors are above all oil and gas, electricity, trade, investment, and construction. As I said, we will give the relevant instructions to the ministers concerned and draft detailed plans based on our common political will to strengthen and develop our bilateral ties. Your Excellency, I think that we could also develop cooperation in security and military affairs. We should also exchange our latest views and assessments of the regional situation and other issues of mutual interest. Thank you for the attention you pay to developing our bilateral relations in all areas, including the humanitarian sphere. You mentioned just now that Iraqi students are studying at Russian universities. They are very positive in their accounts of their time spent here in Russia. I think the number of Iraqi students coming here will grow. We, at any rate, are interested in making this happen. As far as other new opportunities for all-round development of our relations go, we were interested to hear the news that it might be possible to begin direct flights between Russia and Iraq. Once more, thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: There are a few other matters I would like to discuss during today’s meeting. I think that if we could lift some restrictions on our reciprocal trade, it would grow a lot faster. I will address this in more detail later.

We see how the new Iraq is getting back on its feet and developing, and we are very happy for your success. Thank you. Our bilateral trade at the moment is not at such a high level, unfortunately, but there are some very promising big joint projects we can carry out. Russian companies are expanding their activities in Iraq now. There are many big energy companies operating there now, not just Russian companies, but international giants too. I hope our companies will continue steadily expanding their activities, and we hope very much for your support, Mr Prime Minister. We are continuing our contacts in the humanitarian sphere too. I think we have around 150 students from Iraq currently studying at Russian universities. We could take big steps forward in military technical cooperation too. I am very pleased of course that you accepted our invitation to come here and that we have this opportunity to discuss the situation in the region in general. It is a great pleasure to see you and I wish you welcome, Mr Prime Minister. There are a few other matters I would like to discuss during today’s meeting. I think that if we could lift some restrictions on our reciprocal trade, it would grow a lot faster. I will address this in more detail later.

Some significant changes have have been taking place in Iraq since Mr Maliki’s last visit to Moscow in April 2009 – changes for the better. Iraq’s leadership is doing much for complete national reconciliation and accord, socioeconomic problems resolution and restoring country’s positions in the region and on the international arena. We sincerely wish our Iraqi friends success in rebuilding and strengthening their state and see the augmentation of our bilateral trade and economic relations and the deepening of our political dialogue as Russia’s input into the advancement of Iraq toward re-establishing its peaceful living. During today’s detailed talks, we touched on nearly all the issues in our relations. We noted that, regrettably, we are still quite far from the trade level that had been achieved in 2003. At the same time, the growth rates in our relations are a cause for optimism. With every year, more and more Russian companies are participating in Iraq’s economic life. We are grateful to the Iraqi side for resolving an issue that is highly important to us: ensuring security for our experts in Iraq. We are seeing the renewel of our military and technical cooperation as well. Iraqi experts are familiar with our weapons, which have a good reputation, and I am certain that we will reach a mutual understanding in this important field, which certainly increases our trade and economic turnover and heightens the trust between our two states. A session of the intergovernmental commission is scheduled for the end of this year in Baghdad. We also gave the necessary attention to expanding humanitarian relations. In this regard, I should note that since last year, we have increased the quota of state fellowships for Iraqi students in Russian universities to 150. It is pleasing that the Russian Language Chair at the University of Baghdad has never suspended its work for even a single day. We exchanged views on current international issues and regional problems as well. It is gratifying to note that we hold coinciding or very close views on very many positions. In conclusion, I would like to express my certainty that this visit by Mr Prime Minister and his entire team will serve the further development of multidimensional cooperation between Russia and Iraq. Thank you very much for your attention. Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki     al-Maliki NouriVice President of Iraq  (retranslated): Thank you very much, your Excellency. I would like to begin by expressing my sincere gratitude for your invitation to visit Russia, a friendly nation that shares our desire to strengthen our bilateral relations. Both myself and all the members of our delegation felt welcome and sensed a very serious, thoughtful approach to discussing and examining the most pressing issues that are of mutual interest to us. All our rounds of talks with the Russian Government and the President of the Russian Federation fully reflected the desire and readiness of both sides to move forward toward increasing our full range of bilateral cooperation. It has already been stated here that I visited Russia in 2009 at the President’s invitation. At the time, our country was just emerging from a period of religious and civil war, and we were entering a phase of reconstructing our national economy, normalising live in Iraq. At the time, we were already seriously considering prospects for developing cooperation with your country. Today, we are pleased to remark on the significant progress that has been made in various areas – first and foremost, in areas of great importance to both sides such as oil, gas, investment cooperation, construction, transport, political processes, and bringing Iraqi positions closer to those of other countries in the region. During our talks, we had an in-depth discussion of the main areas for potential interaction and cooperation with the Russian Federation and agreed to develop our own sort of “road map” for progressing in all these areas, with priority attention given to such sectors as oil, gas, investments, electric energy, transport, construction, trade, security, military and technical cooperation, the exchange of opinions at a political level and so on. Based on these common approaches and attitudes geared toward promoting our relations, we also share your point of view that today’s bilateral trade is absolutely unacceptable. We must do everything possible from both sides to restore the high figures that we had achieved in the past. We also found common ground on some very sensitive and important issues that affect the fate of the region and the entire world, and came to the conclusion that our positions truly are very similar and even concurrent when it comes to the need to ensure reliable security and stability in this region. Besides, we reached common conclusion that it is imperative to do everything possible to promote the free, democratic development of the peoples in this region, using peaceful means and doing everything in our power to not allow provocation, to avoid external meddling in the region’s affairs, and to prevent various scenarios involving military solutions. Furthermore, we agreed to avoid these types of scenarios when it comes to settling the Syrian crisis, without any kind of foreign meddling, and to support the mission of the new UN Secretary General and League of Arab States’ special envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi. We will do everything we can to ensure the success of his mission, which should result in seeking and finding a peaceful solution to the domestic Syrian crisis that will fully satisfy entire Syrian people. I also thank the Russian leadership, Mr President and the Russian Government for their readiness to provide assistance to Iraq in lifting the mandate of Article 7, since our country has fully fulfilled its obligations. I repeat again that we are deeply grateful to the Russian side and hope that we will be able to resolve all the remaining issues that require implementation by the Iraqi side, now outside the framework of Article 7. In the context of what was already said regarding the need to move forward in key areas of mutual interest, we agreed to intensify our efforts in trade, economic, scientific and technical cooperation through the intergovernmental commission. We will give corresponding instructions to the ministers overseeing these matters so that we can take concrete actions to implement the general ideas and intentions of our countries and our peoples to advance in developing the full range of bilateral cooperation.

            "{'date': '2012-10-10T21:00:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': \"* * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, Today we will talk about the performance of the agricultural sector. Harvesting is nearing completion and I want to thank all the farmers for their hard work, dedication and overall performance. This year has been very difficult in terms of weather conditions, and, unfortunately, this affected the harvest. All of this will be the subject of today's discussion. However, despite the fact that the harvest will not be as good as last year’s, I should say that Russian agribusiness has undoubtedly remained competitive and in recent years has gained a very good pace, which gives us confidence that this year we will not experience any major setbacks in the supply of food, feed grain and so on. Let me remind you that even during the severe drought in 2010 we produced enough grain and other basic crops to satisfy the domestic demand. Last year we had a good harvest, which allowed us to restore and strengthen Russia’s position in the global food markets. This year, the weather conditions have been difficult, as I have said, and as a result, the grain yield is lower than last year. We will hear the Agriculture Minister’s report on this issue. My understanding is that a little over 70 million tonnes have been harvested this year, and last year we had more than 94 million tonnes – that’s a big difference. However, I repeat, this is not a catastrophe. Adverse weather conditions have had a negative impact on the grain harvest, as well as the harvest of several other crops, not just cereals. There is a point I want to underscore, however. I have already said and I want to reiterate that this year’s harvest is sufficient to meet the domestic demand for bread, potatoes and other vegetables, and to supply the processing plants with the necessary raw materials for the production of flour, oil, sugar and all the major food products. At the same time, grain prices are rising and this gives some cause for concern. We will discuss this today since it is the main reason for our meeting. There’s nothing unusual about it: when the harvest is low, the prices grow and when the harvest is good, the prices fall. In the latter case, farmers begin to experience problem, because their aim is to keep the prices at a steady level. There is always a need to find a middle ground, a balance, and we have certain mechanisms at our disposal to help us achieve this. In recent years, we have used these mechanisms with some success. The most difficult situation has developed on the grain market in the Siberian Federal District. The grain harvest is almost one third lower than last year. As a result, the prices for the main grains in Siberia are much higher than in other Russian regions. Although traditionally, as you know, Siberia has always had the lowest grain prices in the country. We must also bear in mind that the grain prices directly affect the cost of feed and, therefore, livestock products. In this situation, we must act quickly yet we must think through all our decisions carefully so that we have a full understanding of the possible consequences for both the consumers and producers of agricultural products. Let me outline several aspects I see as most important here and to which I would like to draw your attention. A week ago, I talked about the need to consider ways to stabilise grain prices. The Government has already decided to start grain interventions. Part of the state fund will be put on the market to stabilise the situation on the grain market in the Siberian Federal District, the Urals and the Far East. I would like to hear your reports today on the progress made, what has already been done, in which Russian regions the grain will be sold, the criteria for granting access to trading, and whether there have been any problems in cooperation with the regional authorities. Another point I would like to stress is that state grain reserves must not be used for profiteering or in any other way other than their intended purpose. We must not allow the export of the grain from our reserves under any circumstances. This is a shared responsibility of the federal and regional authorities. Through careful and targeted measures, the Government must impact the price situation on the market, and ultimately the prices of socially important and sensitive products. This is a crucial economic and social policy challenge. I ask the Government and the regional authorities to carefully monitor the grain interventions, their impact on the market and the way this will be reflected in the end situation at bread shops. Second. A major price component is the grain and flour transportation costs. The reduced rail transportation tariffs for grain from Siberia and the Far East will be in effect until the end of the year. I suggest we consider the possible support measures for our farmers starting from 2013, particularly with regard to grain transportation. Third. This year, almost all of the world’s major grain producers have been hit by adverse weather conditions. The conditions were unfavourable in just about every major grain producing country. This is nothing for us to rejoice about because it will impact the entire global grain market, and the rise in grain prices will be felt globally. Naturally, this makes it more profitable for businesses to export grain, but we must be aware that such actions will inevitably push up prices in the domestic market. I stress that in the current situation the main criterion for local agricultural producers must be to meet the demands of the Russian market. Of course, we are not going to introduce a ban on exports, which was justified following a devastating drought in 2010. At that time the problem was exacerbated by the fact the heatwave of 2010 had been preceded by the drought of 2009, so the weather affected the harvest for two consecutive years. Today the situation is different. At the same time, we must make certain that our exports are made up primarily of grain surpluses and do not affect domestic stability and the Russian market. In order to lay a solid foundation for next year’s harvest, we must now take the utmost care with the autumn sowing campaign, which must be as efficient as possible and conducted at the optimum time. Farms must be provided with seeds, equipment, fuels and lubricants, and fertilisers. You know all that already. I ask the Government and the regional authorities to closely monitor the autumn fieldwork. Finally, another important issue that I would like to discuss with you. Our country has become a full member of the World Trade Organisation. We have secured special terms of agricultural support. We returned again and again to the subject of what timely measures are to be taken to ensure the interests of our agricultural sector, and we talked about a variety of support mechanisms. I know that the previous Government worked on this issue and the current Government is continuing it, in fact jointly with the Presidential Executive Office, and individual Government departments on the other hand. Let us return to this highly sensitive issue today. <…>\", 'kremlin_id': 16627, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting on harvesting progress and situation on grain market', 'teaser': 'The meeting addressed measures for stabilising prices on the grain market, issues of organising the sowing of winter crops and steps to increase the competitiveness of the agro-industrial complex following Russia’s accession to the WTO.', 'tags': ['Agriculture'], 'transcript_filtered': \"Good afternoon, colleagues, Today we will talk about the performance of the agricultural sector. Harvesting is nearing completion and I want to thank all the farmers for their hard work, dedication and overall performance. This year has been very difficult in terms of weather conditions, and, unfortunately, this affected the harvest. All of this will be the subject of today's discussion. However, despite the fact that the harvest will not be as good as last year’s, I should say that Russian agribusiness has undoubtedly remained competitive and in recent years has gained a very good pace, which gives us confidence that this year we will not experience any major setbacks in the supply of food, feed grain and so on. Let me remind you that even during the severe drought in 2010 we produced enough grain and other basic crops to satisfy the domestic demand. Last year we had a good harvest, which allowed us to restore and strengthen Russia’s position in the global food markets. This year, the weather conditions have been difficult, as I have said, and as a result, the grain yield is lower than last year. We will hear the Agriculture Minister’s report on this issue. My understanding is that a little over 70 million tonnes have been harvested this year, and last year we had more than 94 million tonnes – that’s a big difference. However, I repeat, this is not a catastrophe. Adverse weather conditions have had a negative impact on the grain harvest, as well as the harvest of several other crops, not just cereals. There is a point I want to underscore, however. I have already said and I want to reiterate that this year’s harvest is sufficient to meet the domestic demand for bread, potatoes and other vegetables, and to supply the processing plants with the necessary raw materials for the production of flour, oil, sugar and all the major food products.

We have long had an official responsible for overseeing human rights in general, but until recently we did not have an office in charge of this special area related to the protection of entrepreneurs’ rights and interests. We have established it at the suggestion of the business community. I think the reasons for that are obvious. There is a lack of clarity in the current legislation and a shortage of regulations. There are many issues in this area, and all of you are familiar with them, the leaders of business associations and my colleagues, the heads of law enforcement agencies, because it is always a subject of discussion in society: either entrepreneurs are accused of bribing officials, or law enforcement agencies are denounced for various excesses and even corporate raiding, and so on. A number of decisions have been adopted, for example giving businesses the right to file class action lawsuits. Many resolutions have been adopted recently that, in my opinion, should improve the situation in this area, in this vitally important sphere of our activities. I believe that the introduction of an ombudsman who will be charged with protecting entrepreneurs’ legitimate rights and interests will open a new dimension in this field and you will be able to deal directly with the people who are authorised by the state to resolve these issues. My only wish is that Mr Titov and his colleagues in the regions, who are also present here today, do not engage in lobbying the interests of business and defending those who have actually breached the law, but that they direct their efforts at restoring entrepreneurs’ rights if such rights are abused. I have no doubt, unfortunately, that there are many cases of this kind and there is much work to do. What I have absolute confidence in is that the heads of law enforcement and judicial authorities share our aspiration to reduce such cases as far as possible and eventually to eradicate them completely. We are all interested in state agencies’ effective work for the benefit of our cause, because this is a major factor – not the only one but an important factor – of the overall business environment in our country, which is the fundamental condition for attracting investments, both domestic and foreign. Without addressing this issue, we will not be able to successfully develop our economy or achieve the most important indicator – the economic growth rate.

Without addressing this issue, we will not be able to successfully develop our economy or achieve the most important indicator – the economic growth rate.

According to tradition, this holiday is marked in the fall, when the difficult harvest time is almost over. This year, it was literally a hot harvest in the Volga, Ural, and Siberian regions, as they suffered through the hardships of a dry summer. And overall, the weather throughout the nation was, as they say, complicated. We all understand how difficult it is to work in such conditions. But only the agricultural workers – the grain growers, machine operators, agronomists and production organisers – know the hard price of this labour. Present here are representatives of all these professions. And each of you achieved high results. It is no exaggeration to say that your work is selfless. Yes, this harvesting season was truly challenging. But you and your colleagues did everything to fully provide our citizens with grains, potatoes, vegetables, and provide our processing enterprises with raw materials necessary for the production of flour, sugar, oil and other essential foods. Let me stress that the needs of the domestic market and its saturation are our absolute priorities. And the agricultural producers have succeeded in this challenge. In addition, we have reserves to strengthen our export potential. I won’t cite any figures or sum up any specific results or set any particular goals at this gala event – that is the subject for a separate working meeting. Right now, I want to just sincerely thank all of you who often reaped the harvest without any rest, working every day conscientiously and responsibly, under huge pressure. There is a good reason why you are called the providers of Russia. This is a very warm, positive and proud title! People highly appreciate your contribution to our nation’s economy, your role in ensuring our country’s food security, and they respect you for loving and taking care of the land. For centuries, we have valued the work of grain farmers and have always had a special, respectful attitude toward agricultural workers. Naturally, as the saying goes, we cannot live off of bread alone, and it is true; but without bread, it would simply be impossible to live. And our people have always rightly said that bread is the staff of life. This has always been the case and it will always be so. Agricultural production is certainly a strategic resource, and our work in this area is set for the long term. Supporting agricultural producers in every way possible is one of the government’s key objectives. This approach already has positive, ground-breaking results. In just the last few years, the nation’s agro-industrial complex has taken one of the top places in our economy, becoming attractive for investors and for launching new modern productions. We are developing the social infrastructure in rural areas, building housing, roads, and other important facilities. Naturally, this is still not enough, but our work is nevertheless moving forward and living standards are improving. Of course, we still have a great deal of work ahead of us in this domain. But farmers have never been afraid of hard work. This is an area where idleness and laziness are not approved of and where people toil from dawn to dusk: in the fields, on the farms, in small homesteads and major integrated enterprises. I am certain that together, relying on the talent and constructive energy of individuals such as yourselves, we will certainly triumph, making our agriculture prosperous and successful, and our agriculture producers will be masters on the Russian food market, making our country one of the biggest food producers in the world. Friends, the United Nations declared October 15 the International Day of Rural Women. Somehow, the UN has outpaced us on this; we ought to have done it ourselves. I am pleased to congratulate all the women working in rural areas on this holiday. Again, I wish a happy holiday to all our agricultural workers.

Five regions elected governors through direct popular vote, and six regions held elections to the regional parliaments. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Churov, regional and local elections have just taken place. What are the preliminary results? Central Election Commission chairman Vladimir Churov: Yes, the single voting day is over. Almost 5,000 election campaigns took place in 77 different regions around the country, and there were almost 60,000 registered candidates. Following the election system reforms, 27 different parties were able to take part in the elections, 26 parties put forward lists of candidates, and in the final result 25 parties actually took part in the voting. As for gubernatorial elections, which were taking place for the first time after a long hiatus, turnout was quite decent at 50 percent and higher. We expected a good turnout, as there was a lot of interest in the gubernatorial elections. The turnout was a bit lower for the elections to regional legislative assemblies, but was at a similar level to the last round of regional elections. Vladimir Putin: It seems to me that’s always the case: the turnout is always a bit lower for the elections to regional legislative assemblies.  Vladimir Churov: As far as the results go, United Russia is in the lead, followed by the Communist Party [KPRF] in second, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDPR] in third place in general, A Just Russia in fourth place, and in fifth place – the first time with such a result – Patriots of Russia. In the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania they got a quarter of the vote and won almost a fifth of the seats in the republic’s parliament. I should also mention the successes of some of the new parties. Newcomers such as the Communist Party of Social Justice got around 3 percent of the vote on Sakhalin, as did Right Cause, though this is an older party. The Republican Party, which has had its official registration restored, broke the 5-percent threshold in the Bryansk Region. Overall the elections were calm. We received just over 50 appeals on the voting day, some of which were purely formal in nature. Weather conditions in the Far East and Siberia were not the best, with snowfalls, but we made sure that voting took place even in the most remote and difficult-to-access regions. During a videoconference this morning I asked about whether voting had taken place on Cape Krilyon. The border guards there helped to organise the voting. There are not many voters out there, but all the necessary was done.  The web cameras were working for all of the gubernatorial elections, and at the regional authorities’ initiative web cameras were installed at all polling stations for the Kaliningrad mayoral election, and at all polling stations taking part in local elections in the Moscow Region towns of Pushkino, Voskresensk, and Khimki. Acting on the requests from the regions we sent out around half of all of the electronic ballot boxes that we have, equipping 2,500 polling stations with them. Vladimir Putin: So this technology is performing well? Vladimir Churov: The voters like these machines because they talk too. Vladimir Putin: And were there glitches of any kind? Vladimir Churov: We’ve got the full statistics on that. To date, we have 27 polling stations where work was temporarily halted. At 5 polling stations the problems were mostly due to ‘human error’, things like the commission getting mixed up about which stamp to use. Vladimir Putin: Were there any violations registered? Vladimir Churov: Yes, our data and the Interior Ministry reports recorded a number of violations. The Interior Ministry reports give a figure of just over 100 cases, including administrative cases. This figure covers all participants in the election process: the members of the electoral commissions, above all the district commissions, and also the observers, including observers from the media. There were around 100,000 observers. That is an approximate figure. We did not count the total figure, but we know there were a lot. There were tens of thousands for the gubernatorial elections alone. In total, nationwide, 50 people were removed from the polling stations, and in each case a report on administrative violations was drawn up.  Vladimir Putin: Could these violations affect the election results in any way? Vladimir Churov: Not at all. I saw myself how the elections took place in towns where there were problems in the past, in Kasimov, for example, where local elections caused quite a stir during the summer, and Voskresensk, where there were all sorts of problems back in 2003. But this time, now that we have replaced the old local election commissions with new members, there were no problems with the voting. Vladimir Putin: Mr Churov, I want to thank you and all the members of the Central Election Commission and all of your colleagues in the local and regional commissions for their work. This work is always high-pressure and requires a lot of dedication, organisation, and discipline. Your colleagues have displayed these qualities and I thank you for this.  The election results are not a surprise for me. I think they reconfirm the voters’ support for the current institutions of government and our policies to develop Russia’s statehood, and I thank the voters for their support.  I will meet with the newly elected leaders. We are in constant contact, and I will of course remind them that the public wants to see effective and energetic work from them. The main task of those elected, whether deputies of legislative assemblies or executive heads, is to resolve the tasks facing their regions and the country as a whole. People expect to see real results from their work. There are still a lot of problems, but the overwhelming majority of those elected are experienced professionals who know how to work. They now have to prove their qualities and live up to the trust the voters have placed in them. I hope too, that they will pay attention to the demands of those who did not win in these elections. Far from all of the opposition parties’ demands are unacceptable or unnecessary. On the contrary, they have many useful proposals, and their views should be taken into account too in work together. Once again, thank you very much for organising these elections. Vladimir Churov: Mr President, on behalf of our electoral system, let me thank you for signing the very important law enabling us to set up the district election commissions for the term of five years. Given that the election process in general in Russia is becoming more open and better organised, it will be easier for us to train the local election commissions over a five-year period. We have already introduced a testing system and will soon complete work on the procedures for establishing the local commissions. By next April, in accordance with the law’s provisions, we will start establishing these new ‘semi-professional’ district election commissions. We are very grateful to you for this law, as it was a longstanding request of ours. We also want to thank the law enforcement agencies. We have a joke that goes: ‘the police work ideally on voting day, so let’s hold elections every day’. The police worked as well as always and there were no serious incidents. Everything went smoothly and our local election commission members felt safe. There was just one incident – in Saratov Region. The situation in Khimki was potentially tense by evening, but there too, I was monitoring the situation and I think the police worked very well, without any problems. Vladimir Putin: Good, this is very pleasing to hear. Let me say again that in my view, after the presidential election, this is the latest big step in strengthening our country’s statehood and putting in place the conditions for energetic and effective development over the coming years and the medium term. Thank you very much for your work. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16642, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting with Central Election Commission Chairman Vladimir Churov', 'teaser': 'Mr Churov briefed Vladimir Putin on the results of elections held in a number of regions around the country.', 'tags': ['Civil service', 'Regions'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Mr Churov, regional and local elections have just taken place.

Let me say again that in my view, after the presidential election, this is the latest big step in strengthening our country’s statehood and putting in place the conditions for energetic and effective development over the coming years and the medium term.

Today, we will witness the launch of the first phase of the Boguchansk Hydroelectric Power Plant. As you recall, the work to build it began back in Soviet era, in 1980. Then in the mid-1990s, 1994 to be specific, everything came to a halt. It was only in 2006 that we resumed efforts to implement this project fully. Today, a very important step is to take place: we will be launching two units. The entire project should be completed soon. I should say that in the last four years, we brought 12 giga-watts of new energy generation into operation, and by the end of this year we should be implementing 6 more giga-watts. These are very rapid rates. The new power plant will certainly give strong momentum to the economy of the entire Krasnoyarsk Territory, as well as all of Siberia, increasing the reliability of its consolidated power supply system and offering new opportunities for developing the economy. This will include new production facilities and new social services such as stadiums, hospitals and educational institutions, because it is impossible to build anything if there is not enough electrical power. This no doubt includes the Boguchansk Aluminium Smelter, a major company that creates many new high-level jobs. I very much count on the executives of RusHydro and RUSAL to do everything in order for these projects to develop as vigorously as possible for the good of our people. This is a very good example of a public-private partnership. I already mentioned the RusHydro and RUSAL companies; this work was structured through involvement of Vnesheconombank and the level of its organisation was commendable. Aggregate investments in the project exceeded 90 billion rubles [about 3 billion dollars] – these are very serious investments. As of October 1, 2012, 77 billion rubles have already been invested, including 60 billion rubles from the RusHydro and RUSAL companies, and 17 billion from Vnesheconombank. Boguchansk HPP will be at its full capacity very soon and I would like to point out the need for strict adherence to all environmental requirements. There is one more issue to which I want to draw the attention of all the participants in this project, as well as regional and local authorities. Constructing such facilities certainly affects people’s interests. It is done for the people, but it also affects their interests – particularly those who live in the nearby areas. I am not sure that all the social issues are fully– this is something I want to stress – fully resolved. I demand that the authorities at all levels and the executives at the companies take this into account. Of course, these efforts should be supervised by the governors. In the immediate future I expect information and reports on what has been done for people who are being displaced, what has been done to maintain environmental safety, and in general on all issues of this nature. But overall, I would like to once again emphasise that this is a major event for the economy of Siberia and all of Russia. I congratulate all of you on this result. I give the floor to our colleagues. Viktor Uporov [General Director of Boguchansk HPP Construction Company]: Good evening, Mr President, Today is a momentous day for hydropower construction workers and energy sector professionals: the power plant is ready to launch its first hydraulic unit. The construction history of the Boguchansk HPP stretches back over the past 30 years. The launch was initially planned in 1992. On October 25 we will celebrate the 25th anniversary of damming Angara. However, the construction was halted with the beginning of perestroika. One of the oldest veterans of Boguchansk HPP construction is with us here today: Dmitry Sarikiyan started working at the hydroelectric power plant in 1981. He participated in the laying of the first block of concrete and damming the Angara River. He is still working on the construction site. We have many people like him, and thanks to their dedication the construction project kept going strong through the most difficult years. Mr President, in October 2005, you issued instructions to the Government of the Russian Federation to complete the construction of the Boguchansk HPP. Teams of designers, construction and installation companies embarked on the project; factories received orders for manufacturing equipment. The city of Kodinsk came to life again. Work began in the Krasnoyarsk Territory on the construction of roads, power lines of the Boguchansk Aluminium Smelter and other facilities. Mr President, we are very grateful to you for the years of hard work for the benefit of the people, for developing Eastern Siberia and all of Russia. In May 2012, we began filling the reservoir. The pre-commissioning work began at the site under the direction and control of lead engineers and the Federal Service for Supervision of Environment, Technology and Nuclear Management. We plan to launch three hydraulic units in the near future, gradually put the remaining six generating units into operation, and the Boguchansk HPP will reach its design capacity of 3,000 mega-watts in 2013. The power plant has cutting edge monitoring and control systems. Having learnt a lesson from the accident at the Sayano-Shushenskaya HPP, we provided for closing gates and guide vanes in case of power outage, and a host of other solutions. The Boguchansk HPP is the most advanced and one of the top five largest hydroelectric power plants in Russia. Mr President, two hydraulic units of the Boguchansk HPP have passed through the entire complex of commissioning and testing procedures and are ready to be put into operation. Will you give the order to launch two hydraulic units of the Boguchansk Hydroelectric Power Plant? Vladimir Putin: Launch the units. Viktor Uporov: Construction veteran Dmitry Sarikiyan will press the start button together with a representative of our young professionals, Roman Perevalov. Vladimir Putin: Go ahead. Viktor Uporov: Launch the units. Our colleagues are approaching the hydraulic unit’s control panel and are about to press the start button. This is the most reliable and modern automatic control system. At the moment, the automatic system is processing the launch algorithm. Now you can hear a noise: the guiding device is opening, the shaft is rotating and the unit is gaining momentum. The synchronisation is in progress. Vladimir Putin: Congratulations to all of you, to everyone who worked at the site and continues to work here: the builders, engineers and workers. Mr Sarikiyan, how did you feel when the work practically stopped in 1994? How did you manage to keep the site in the condition in which it was when we resumed the work in 2006? Dmitry Sarikiyan: Naturally, when the construction was halted, there was some uncertainty; we did not know what the future held for us. But we were confident that a construction project of such calibre would have to be resumed one day. That gave us strength. When it was decided to resume the construction of Boguchansk HPP, the people were very happy. You could say that they had waited for that moment for thirty years. This would be an unforgettable event in the life of any person, but if you put your sweat and blood in the project, it’s a real holiday.  Vladimir Putin: How many people worked here in the 1990s? How many people were employed in the project in the period from 1994 to 2005? Viktor Uporov: The Boguchansk HPP employed about 600 people. Vladimir Putin: And now? Viktor Uporov: We have over 4,000 people working at the construction site. Vladimir Putin: I congratulate you once again on this momentous event, and I want to thank you with all my heart for your hard work, your patience and your confidence that the power plant will be completed. Good luck to you! All the best. Viktor Uporov: Mr President, we would like to invite you to the launch ceremony in the autumn of 2013, when all nine units will be in operation and the power plant will reach its full capacity. Vladimir Putin: Thank you, I will be happy to attend.

I should note straight away that the power industry has been and is a highly important component in Russia’s economy. Russia’s energy security depends greatly on its reliable and stable functioning. “Energy security” is such a vague term, but we all understand that without the electric power industry, without developing power grid facilities, there may be no industrial manufacturing growth. We also cannot improve the social sector or our export potential without developing the power industry and our power grid facilities. I recall very well – and you probably do, too – the problems that we faced after the so-called “ice rain” when all the weak points of the power grid became absolutely clear, such as lack of capacities, low quality of performance and deterioration at times. In the 2000s, significant structural transformations were made in the sector, private investors got involved, and over the last five years capital investments in the power industry have accounted for over 3.7 trillion rubles [$120 billion]. We have brought over 90,000 kilometres of electric power lines into operation. I will also note that the Federal Grid Company of Unified Energy System (FGC UES) currently owns more than 124,000 kilometres of backbone power lines, while the Interregional Distribution Grid Companies Holding (IDGC Holding) is managing over two million kilometres of distribution grids in 69 regions of Russia. Their main task is to ensure reliability, quality and accessibility to electric power supply services for consumers. The two companies have launched major investment projects and within next three years, FGC UES intends to implement an investment programme worth over 500 billion rubles [$16 billion], while IDGC Holding plans to invest over 300 billion rubles. At the same time, the logic of economy demands changing and improving the management mechanisms in electric power companies. As you remember, we discussed this issue at the first session of the Commission for Strategic Development of the Fuel and Energy Sector and Environmental Security, I believe, on July 10 of this year. The ministries have already prepared specific suggestions. However, before we review them, I want to draw your attention to a few key issues. First, changes in the management should ultimately benefit the consumers of these companies’ services. Our people and organisations should be able to connect to electrical grids without delays and problems, ideally at financially justified prices, at reasonable rates. At the same time, as I said earlier, it is very important how much a consumer will pay for electricity. Russia’s large energy resources and their relatively low cost remain its economy’s competitive advantages, even though in recent years their cost has increased significantly and continues to grow, in part due to an increase in the grid component cost that, on average, accounts for over one third of the cost of electricity for the end consumer – more than one third. New, better managementmust play an important role in curbing the growth in electricity prices. Second, we will have to increase the efficacy of the common technical power supply network and its competitiveness, first and foremost, by reducing the share of capital and operational costs of the companies, introducing an energy efficiency programme, and reducing electrical transmission losses. We will need broader use of innovative approaches to grids exploitation, intellectual energy networks and energy systems. Synchronising programmes for developing backbone networks and distribution grids is also an important objective, as is conducting a unified technological policy. Third, I believe that in adjusting the management mechanisms for power grid facilities, it is imperative to take into account the interests of all the companies’ shareholders. The measures taken should be viewed positively by the investment community, including minority shareholders. As you recall, at the recent VTB Capital RUSSIA CALLING! Investment Forum both Russian and foreign entrepreneurs once again stressed the need to protect the rights of minority shareholders more effectively. Overall, we know perfectly well that the economies where the rights of minority shareholders are securely guaranteed, see more money inflow, and the money feels safer there. Right now, the state holds controlling stakes in the main energy companies. It holds a 79.55 percent share of the capital stock in FGC UES, while minority shareholders account for 20.45 percent. The corresponding figures for IDGC Holding are 54.52 and 45.48 percent of shares. I think that we all understand that the percentages of minority shareholders are significant and securing their rights is an important condition for attracting new investments, as I already said, both Russian and foreign. For them, it is very important to have a favourable business climate, reliability, and predictability of our steps. Overall, I would like to note the importance of continuing daily efforts to create an effective institutional environment for attracting investments in energy. The Cabinet must make a series of key regulatory decisions by the end of the year. I am referring to mechanisms for the wholesale and retail market, the gradual elimination of cross-subsidies, and clear and predictable rules that are necessary for attracting long-term investments in the electric power network. We certainly must remove various barriers for entrepreneurs in getting connected to power grids. Unfortunately, we still have not fully resolved this problem. At the end of last year and the beginning of this one, we took a number of steps that were assessed quite highly by market participants and generally reflected positively on the development of the national electric power complex. But it seems we did not do enough, and this work will need to be continued. As for possible structural changes, they must be deliberate, thought-out, without any excessively impulsive actions; they must be based on the practical operation of the companies in recent years. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that both market participants and the governors of the Russian Federation’s regions regularly raise questions about improving the management mechanisms. But this does not mean we should act impulsively, without thinking through all the consequences of every step that you will be proposing today in this domain.

Let’s get to work. I want to welcome everyone who has gathered here in Moscow and our colleagues in Grozny, in the North Caucasus. Today we will discuss the performance of our key agencies responsible for countering organised crime and terrorism. We will talk about coordinating the efforts of different agencies working in this sphere and neutralising one of the most serious and dangerous threats to our nation and its citizens: the terrorist threat. The first thing I would like to note is that we should continue to act with utmost decisiveness. A great deal has changed in recent years: new highly effective methods for combatting organised crime and terrorism have appeared. As a result, our agencies have become much more efficient. At the same time, we pay a high price for every mistake, therefore we must act relentlessly, decisively and, when necessary, aggressively, and always stay one step ahead. But this aggression must be directed at militants, terrorists and criminals, and great care must be taken to protect law-abiding citizens, ordinary people in the course of any counter-terrorist operations. Our armed forces, security and law enforcement agencies have recently made a number of important strides forward in this area. In the past several months, 479 militants have been detained and 313 terrorists have been killed during clashes, those who refused to surrender, including 43 ringleaders. We must continue to act in coordination. The efficiency of our efforts to a large extent depends on our teamwork. The terrorist infrastructure must be destroyed. Our law enforcement agencies have learned to do it, but let me reiterate: we must work unremittingly, striving for maximum coordination. Recent exercises in the North Caucasus demonstrated, among other things, that now that the period of intense fighting with the deployment of the Armed Forces ended several years ago, the coordination of actions has taken on special importance in the current conditions. The events that were held and which are now being completed are necessary in order to ensure that the officers and military personnel from various departments of different ministries feel that they are part of a single team and understand each other without a word. This is very important. Second, I would like to note that in the next several years Russia will host a number of high-profile events, both in politics and sports. It is a matter of honour for law enforcement agencies and special services to do everything in their power to ensure that these events take place in a positive working or festive atmosphere, and are not marred by anything. This is a major challenge for the entire global community and for Russia because we can see what is happening in many countries. We have some tensions and hot spots in this country, but we also have great strength, skills and means to promptly remove any possible threats. I want to draw your attention to this and call upon you to ensure that you begin to tackle these challenges in good time. It is essential to continue coordinated targeted military operations in order to stop terrorist activities of those who do not wish to lay down arms. Unfortunately, they still remain.

Let’s get to work. I want to welcome everyone who has gathered here in Moscow and our colleagues in Grozny, in the North Caucasus. Today we will discuss the performance of our key agencies responsible for countering organised crime and terrorism. We will talk about coordinating the efforts of different agencies working in this sphere and neutralising one of the most serious and dangerous threats to our nation and its citizens: the terrorist threat. The first thing I would like to note is that we should continue to act with utmost decisiveness. A great deal has changed in recent years: new highly effective methods for combatting organised crime and terrorism have appeared. As a result, our agencies have become much more efficient. At the same time, we pay a high price for every mistake, therefore we must act relentlessly, decisively and, when necessary, aggressively, and always stay one step ahead. But this aggression must be directed at militants, terrorists and criminals, and great care must be taken to protect law-abiding citizens, ordinary people in the course of any counter-terrorist operations. Our armed forces, security and law enforcement agencies have recently made a number of important strides forward in this area. In the past several months, 479 militants have been detained and 313 terrorists have been killed during clashes, those who refused to surrender, including 43 ringleaders. We must continue to act in coordination. The efficiency of our efforts to a large extent depends on our teamwork. The terrorist infrastructure must be destroyed. Our law enforcement agencies have learned to do it, but let me reiterate: we must work unremittingly, striving for maximum coordination. Recent exercises in the North Caucasus demonstrated, among other things, that now that the period of intense fighting with the deployment of the Armed Forces ended several years ago, the coordination of actions has taken on special importance in the current conditions. The events that were held and which are now being completed are necessary in order to ensure that the officers and military personnel from various departments of different ministries feel that they are part of a single team and understand each other without a word. This is very important. Second, I would like to note that in the next several years Russia will host a number of high-profile events, both in politics and sports. It is a matter of honour for law enforcement agencies and special services to do everything in their power to ensure that these events take place in a positive working or festive atmosphere, and are not marred by anything. This is a major challenge for the entire global community and for Russia because we can see what is happening in many countries. We have some tensions and hot spots in this country, but we also have great strength, skills and means to promptly remove any possible threats. I want to draw your attention to this and call upon you to ensure that you begin to tackle these challenges in good time. It is essential to continue coordinated targeted military operations in order to stop terrorist activities of those who do not wish to lay down arms. Unfortunately, they still remain. It is important that these efforts give the most effective results possible in the future, so that all counter-terrorism operations are worked out in detail, and the actions and resources of the various ministries and agencies are coordinated, as I said. Next. The information campaign, the work with the public must reach a qualitatively new level, especially in the regions where these special events are held or where the terrorist threat is still making itself felt. In conclusion, I want to thank all those involved in counter-terrorism operations, who risk their lives for our citizens to live in safety and to feel safe.

VTB Bank Chairman and CEO Andrei Kostin     Kostin AndreiVTB Bank Chairman : Good evening, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Mr Kostin, you have an interesting new project underway. What is the project’s name – Summer Bank? Andrei Kostin: That’s right, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Tell me about it. Andrei Kostin: VTB Group places a lot of importance on working with the public. This is reflected in our figures: for the first time, the volume of loans we extended to individuals in the first three quarters of this year broke the 1 trillion-ruble mark, and we expect to increase this figure by a further 15 percent by the end of the year. As for mortgage loans, this year will see their volume double overall from 80 billion rubles last year to 160 billion roubles this year. But we think that a big share of the general public, around 20 million people by our estimates, are still not getting all the banking services they could be. These people tend to be low-income earners living in smaller towns around the country. To address this problem, we decided last week to launch a new project, which we have named Summer Bank. The focus groups we conducted show that this name is a positive choice because everyone likes summer. We plan to open around 1,000 small branches over the next three years, mostly in the regional capitals and smaller towns, and we want to attract as many as five million new customers. We will basically focus on small loans. For example, a family with a 15,000-ruble monthly income could borrow the equivalent of their monthly income for whatever needs they might have. The branches will have a new-look format. They will have a welcoming atmosphere and open layout without the usual partitions, and will look more like… Vladimir Putin: What will this give the public? What are the advantages for them in these banking services? Andrei Kostin: It’s about us reaching out to the public. For a start, we are bringing banking services closer to them and offering services to people who banks were never so interested in working with in the past because the loans involved are only small but each loan involves a lot of time and work, as you end up with small loans but a lot of them. This makes speed and information technology very important. We will use the internet and cell phones so that people can get small loans, make settlements, payments and money transfers fast, without having to wait in line and come to the bigger towns and so on. They will do this through the Summer Bank, which will provide the new infrastructure. Vladimir Putin: So, this is a bank focused on work with individuals? Andrei Kostin: It will work only with individuals. Vladimir Putin: I hope the project will be carried out and people will see its benefits.

This is not a new area of work for you, given that you were governor of one of the Central Federal District’s regions for a long time, and so you have hands-on experience of work in the regions, but running a ministry is nonetheless a responsibility of a different level and involves tasks of a bigger scale. I propose that we go over the whole range of issues. Regional Development Minister Igor Slyunyayev     Slyunyayev IgorMinister of Regional Development : Thank you, Mr President. First, I think the main task at this stage is to analyse your instructions to the Regional Development Ministry and address in comprehensive fashion the problems in the housing sector, urban development, and housing and utilities. The second priority is related to the budget’s passage through the State Duma, given that the federal targeted programmes and federal special investment programmes are instruments that can have a big impact on the situation in the regions.  The third task is analysing the construction market – industrial, civil, housing, and transport construction – and finding mechanisms for bringing down project, design and construction costs. Another priority is to establish constructive dialogue with the regions. I firmly believe that the country’s strength lies in its regions, and we need to make this a two-way street: the federal government sets standards and provides assistance, and the regions give feedback and provide support for the federal initiatives. Vladimir Putin: The Ministry has many tasks before it, but there is one issue I want you not to forget under circumstances. You must give it your particular attention. This is the issue of relocating people from the housing that is old and no longer fit for residence. We have a programme in this area and have earmarked the funds for it, and it is important that every ruble be spent effectively and that time not be wasted in resolving the problems that have built up in this area over decades. Most important of all is to adopt the regulations and rules that will ensure that practical work is organised in such fashion as to steadily reduce the share of this kind of old and unfit housing in the housing stock, and under no circumstances let it increase. This is a task that requires particular determination, inventiveness, and good management skills.  I hope that you will ensure this is the case, and I ask you to give this issue your particular attention. Igor Slyunyayev: Thank you, Mr President. I want to say thank you for the Housing and Utilities Reform Facilitation Fund, which is a very effective instrument that has helped us to tackle this housing problem over the last few years. One more task that will be on the agenda right from the start is ensuring that the heating season goes smoothly throughout the whole country.

Russia is one of the most active players on this global market and we are firmly in second place overall in terms of arms exports around the world.  We value our reputation as an honest and responsible partner in military technical cooperation. Russia signs arms and military equipment contracts only with lawful and legitimate governments and only for the purposes of ensuring sovereign defence capability. In carrying out our work in this area we always make a comprehensive assessment of the specific situation in each particular part of the world. Far from all of the big arms exporters take as scrupulous an attitude as we do in this area. Our position is that only sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council are justifiable grounds for not selling arms to particular countries. In all other cases no one has the right under any pretext to dictate to Russia or any other country with whom and how it may conduct trade. Unilateral or collective bans and restrictions that are outside the UN Security Council framework — all the more so when politically motivated — are not international legal norms with the consequences that ensue. Russia will continue to develop its military technical cooperation and will unfailingly carry out all of its obligations.  I note that our current export contracts are all being performed exactly as planned. Over the first nine months of this year we delivered military goods worth a total value of $10.7 billion. This accounts for around 80 percent of the total contracts planned for this year. We forecast a slight increase in arms and military equipment exports this year as compared to 2011. Now we need to bolster this positive trend. Competition on the modern arms and military equipment market is extremely intense. We therefore need to make use of qualitatively new approaches and show flexibility and ability to make timely responses. This is the basis upon which we will develop our military technical cooperation with our partners from the BRICS Group – Brazil, India, China, and South Africa, and also with Vietnam. We will discuss all of this in detail today. The BRICS countries have been steadily gaining in political, economic and technological weight over these last years and have been posting stable, high growth rates. Between them, the BRICS countries account for 43 percent of the world’s population and around a fifth of global GDP. We have established a constructive dialogue within the group and are successfully coordinating action on a broad range of issues on the global and regional agendas. We are actively developing our trade and investment ties.  As far as military technical cooperation goes, India and China are both longstanding key partners for Russia. We see good prospects for developing this area of relations with Brazil and South Africa too.  Vietnam is another longstanding partner of ours in this sector. There was a hiatus in the 1990s, but now we are steadily building up our military technical cooperation once again. Given the growing technological, industrial and scientific potential of the countries I mentioned, our military technical cooperation with them can and must move to a qualitatively new level. What do I mean by a qualitatively new level? I am referring to deeper production cooperation and joint R&D, establishing effective maintenance and post-sale service systems, and working together to enter third countries’ markets.  As you know, our cooperation with India is not limited to delivering ready-made models of our defence industry’s goods. Joint R&D work and licensed production, including for supply to other countries, are also gaining more importance. There are clear advantages here: joint production makes it possible to cut production costs, obtain and introduce new technology, including dual-purpose technology, and organise a rational system for transferring technology from the defence to the civil sector.  At the same time, Russian manufacturers’ intellectual property rights and the globally recognised Russian brands must be fully protected from unlawful copying. We should also use military technical cooperation mechanisms for obtaining foreign technology and individual samples needed for developing our own defence industry.  I think we all realise that simply purchasing foreign military goods without mastering the production process here in Russia itself does not make sense. On another issue, we also need to improve the legal framework for military technical cooperation and update our bilateral and multilateral agreements in line with today’s reality. Most important of all, we need to develop a long-term cooperation programme.  We need to raise intergovernmental commissions’ effectiveness in order to strengthen coordination with our key partners, and arrange regular meetings between experts and specialists.  In general, deepening civilised, honest and mutually-advantageous partnership in the military technical cooperation sector gives us a very valuable instrument for guaranteeing our foreign policy interests. This is an integral part of our efforts to counter global threats and challenges. As you know, the Executive Order on implementing Russia’s foreign policy set out the tasks in this area. I ask you to keep in mind that the approach I have outlined in military technical cooperation, especially as concerns work with our traditional partners, is a priority.  Let’s discuss all of this now. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16673, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting of the Commission for Military Technology Cooperation with Foreign Countries', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin held a meeting of the Commission for Military Technology Cooperation with Foreign Countries.', 'tags': ['Armed Forces', 'National security'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, colleagues, Today, we will discuss how to make our military technical cooperation with foreign countries more effective. Russia is one of the most active players on this global market and we are firmly in second place overall in terms of arms exports around the world.  We value our reputation as an honest and responsible partner in military technical cooperation. Russia signs arms and military equipment contracts only with lawful and legitimate governments and only for the purposes of ensuring sovereign defence capability. In carrying out our work in this area we always make a comprehensive assessment of the specific situation in each particular part of the world. Far from all of the big arms exporters take as scrupulous an attitude as we do in this area. Our position is that only sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council are justifiable grounds for not selling arms to particular countries. In all other cases no one has the right under any pretext to dictate to Russia or any other country with whom and how it may conduct trade. Unilateral or collective bans and restrictions that are outside the UN Security Council framework — all the more so when politically motivated — are not international legal norms with the consequences that ensue. Russia will continue to develop its military technical cooperation and will unfailingly carry out all of its obligations.  I note that our current export contracts are all being performed exactly as planned. Over the first nine months of this year we delivered military goods worth a total value of $10.7 billion. This accounts for around 80 percent of the total contracts planned for this year. We forecast a slight increase in arms and military equipment exports this year as compared to 2011. Now we need to bolster this positive trend. Competition on the modern arms and military equipment market is extremely intense. We therefore need to make use of qualitatively new approaches and show flexibility and ability to make timely responses. This is the basis upon which we will develop our military technical cooperation with our partners from the BRICS Group – Brazil, India, China, and South Africa, and also with Vietnam. We will discuss all of this in detail today. The BRICS countries have been steadily gaining in political, economic and technological weight over these last years and have been posting stable, high growth rates.

This is an excellent initiative and I want to thank all of you for supporting it.

One of the Front’s goals is to create a new opportunity for civil society to take an active part in the Government's most important decisions. * * * Excerpts from transcript of meeting with core members of the Russian Popular Front President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, colleagues, I am very pleased that we have such a representative gathering today, including members of various public organisations, trade unions, political parties and youth movements. During the presidential election campaign and immediately afterwards we said that we must continue our efforts. There were many discussions about the objectives the RPF was created to pursue and whether it is just a campaign tool. Indeed, it did serve as a political campaign tool, but that was not its only purpose. My original understanding was that if we succeed in creating a broad public coalition, and that is exactly what the Popular Front has become, then it would simply be wrong and wasteful not to let it get involved in social processes. In fact, everything that has been done in Moscow and around the country was achieved with the direct involvement of work teams, the people, our citizens, and it is a very good feedback tool that lets us know what is being done and how successfully in different parts of the country. To begin with, I want to thank you: many of you present here took an active part in the preparation of the national development programme. You may have noticed that my first executive orders as President of the Russian Federation dated May 7, 2012 deal with many issues that you formulated. They are all identified there, and not just identified but the executive orders set the deadlines and outline the means we will use to address the challenges facing our country. This prompts a very simple and logical conclusion: if the people represented in the Russian Popular Front formulated the national development programme, then you should have the opportunity to oversee how the targets you have set are being met. This is a very important part of any political initiative, and so, as we agreed, I suggested that we meet to discuss what we can do in the future and in what format. The first task, which I talked about in the past and would like to go back to now, is control over the execution. The tasks themselves have been formalised in the plans and specific documents, including the Presidential executive orders, but we are all adults here – some of us are older, some younger, but we are all adults – and we understand that life is full of problems and surprises, and there is always need for adjustments. Therefore, as we implement any initiative, tackle any challenge facing the nation, there are always some details that we must respond to quickly but efficiently and competently. Therefore, the second task, which is directly linked to the first one, is to respond to everything that happens in real life, so that we can quickly make amendments, perhaps even change our plans and priorities. Many of you asked at our previous meetings: What should be the format of the Popular Front’s work? Some colleagues suggested that we should establish a political party, but I said that perhaps it may become an option in the future but at this point it would limit the scope of our activities. Why? Because if the Russia Popular Front is a broad public coalition, then as soon as we establish a political party, the scope of its activities will be limited. Right now the Russian Popular Front can involve various public organisations in its work, including different parties, not only United Russia or Patriots of Russia but any political parties that share our views on national development. This will make the organisation more vibrant, because when it includes people who share strategic objectives but have different ideas about how to achieve these goals, it allows you to launch a discussion on any vital issue, and that creates an opportunity to find the most effective solutions to the challenges faced by our country. Therefore, I would like to suggest that you hold a founding congress and establish the nationwide public organisation Russian Popular Front, which will involve public organisations, political parties and private individuals in its activities. Don’t put it off for too long; you should hold the congress sometime in the next few months – it would probably be best to do it in the spring. I propose that we consider this together today. I will finish my monologue so that we can talk informally about any issues that may arise. Go ahead, please. * * * Vladimir Putin: What we are seeing now is precisely the process we spoke about and aimed for: using United Russia’s instruments we are drawing in a broad range of people who are not themselves United Russia party members but share our common values about the country’s development and about work in the regional and federal political organisations. One more very important thing that I think has principle significance is that, as we see here, we have young people who are just starting out on their road in life, and we have people who have already accomplished much in their various fields. I am friends with many of them and I see how they go about building their lives. Successful people only look forward, never look back. We should make use of the foundations that others laid in the years past, but we must keep our gaze set forward, take as our reference only the very best examples and practice, and stay one step ahead at all times. Only then will we be successful. Alexei Lavrinenko (collective farm chairman, Stavropol Territory): I hope that our discussion will result in a decision on how we, the Popular Front, will supervise all that we have brought together. If we just make it an updated version of ‘people’s control’ this will be just more effort in vain, but if we set up a body that really does help, advise, and contribute to finding new reserves, then we will get results. We do not need a party but a public movement. Seeing the election results and the support for the Popular Front, we realise that the public has confidence in us, in you, and believes that we will indeed make our lives better. My only desire is for us all to live in happiness, neither rich nor poor, but simply happy in a normal happy country, and we must do everything we possibly can to achieve this. Vladimir Putin: You raised a very important practical issue just now, namely, how to carry out this public supervision. You are right; we do not need any new versions of ‘people’s control’. We need people to oversee not just what we say and what gets written in our documents, but, as I said, we also need people to give us real feedback about what is happening in the country, make adjustments to plans, and perhaps set new tasks in line with the constantly changing circumstances. Life is complex and diverse, and we therefore need a mechanism that works effectively, but the question is how to establish it and what this will require?  The first thought that comes to mind is to have the National Popular Front’s various component political groups work to get their representatives into the government bodies, into executive and legislative bodies (the legislative assemblies), and perhaps propose them for work in the executive bodies. This alone is not enough though, and we will have to reflect on other possible mechanisms and instruments. This will be one of the subjects of discussion for the founding congress. * * * Vladimir Putin (replying to a question about direct gubernatorial elections from Aslambek Paskachev, chairman of the public movement Russian Congress of the Peoples of the Caucasus): You raised one of the key issues of our political life today. To speak frankly and openly, the previous system of appointing regional heads was dictated above all by the problems with secret ballot voting in the North Caucasus republics. This was related to my personal experience of the serious situation in 1999, when Karachayevo-Circassia held its first election, which was immediately followed by shooting and victims the very first night. Voting in these republics takes place along ethnic lines. One ethnic group is bigger than the others. Unfortunately, we have not yet reached the stage where people vote based on personal and professional qualities and abstract themselves from the ethnic issue. They vote for personal and professional qualities, so long as the candidate is from their own ethnic group. This is the reality of our life and traditions, and we have to respect this. It is important to remember this. You cannot just ignore it and tell people, ‘No, you should do things as we dictate’. We are to show respect for even the smallest ethnic groups and respect their traditions and culture. At the same time, we must do this in a way that guarantees the rights of every ethnic group, so that people know that they have the right to take part in the process and that their vote really does matter.  When I say that their vote really does matter, I think you understand what I am getting at. As I said, if you have different ethnic groups of different sizes and hold simple direct secret ballot elections, you will always end up with people from one and the same ethnic group elected, and the other groups will not be happy. This is something we must take into account and we must respect the rights of even the smallest groups. The problem is finding the right formula. This is not an easy task at all. In Daghestan, for example, there was a system operating de-facto in violation of the laws and Constitution. There was a quota system designed to accommodate the various ethnic and religious groups. If the president was an Avar, for example, the prime minister would automatically be a Dargwa, and the speaker of the parliament would be a Kumyk. There was a rotation system in place. This is all a complicated thing, but that was the system that the people there came up with. You cannot simply come in and dictate from above here. But at the same time – and it is important to remember this — we also cannot have one set of rules for one region and other rules in other regions, because this would divide our common political space and our country would cease to be a single unified state. This would be unacceptable. * * * Vladimir Putin: All the same our society is evolving, becoming stronger and more dynamic simultaneously. And I think it is right not only to give citizens the right to elect their regional leaders, but to shift the responsibility for that choice to citizens themselves. This is a very important thing for cultivating a sense of responsibility to one’s region, country, the future of the nation and our children. This responsibility does not emerge immediately. Some people do not care while some don't even think about it, but if the responsibility is not delegated, it will never be accepted. Mikhail Leontyev (journalist, TV anchor): It would be easier to elect senators directly. Why should they not be elected? Vladimir Putin: This is also something that must come. So I still think that we did the right thing by changing to a system in which regional leaders are elected directly. Another factor is that our country is complex, and finding a formula that would be applicable everywhere yet take into account the nuances of each particular region is a difficult task. Let's think about this and look for an answer together. * * * Vladimir Putin (in answer to the question of State Duma deputy from Stavropol Territory, Olga Timofeeva, regarding the ban on headscarves in a school in the Territory): We must always treat people’s religious convictions with great respect. This is very important and should be reflected in all aspects of state policy, in everything. That is the first thing. Second. We live in a secular state and this must be our starting point. We also have a multi-religious country, but the general rule of a secular country must apply: our church and our state are separate. This is a very important aspect of our lives today and in the future. And the third thing. We should look at how our neighbours, for example European countries, resolve these problems and everything will become clear. But everything should be done calmly, in an acceptable fashion, one that does not offend anyone and in dialogue with representatives of various faiths. I've seen how some respected people, including in Islamic circles, speak and talk about the value of the fact that we live in a secular state. Why? Because if we were to move in some other direction then – please pay your attention to the fact that over 80 percent of our people formally or informally self-identify as Orthodox – then we should be aware that if not all are equal and do not acknowledge the secularism of our country, then the representatives of other, even major traditional religions will feel aggrieved in one way or another in the near future. It is better that all feel equal. This is the first thing. And the second: I would suggest — but the specific suggestions should be generated at the regional level and perhaps even the municipal one – introducing a school uniform. Not necessarily as in Soviet times when there was one for the entire country, but it is quite possible for the regions to introduce a common school uniform. So the problem is not only related to religious affiliation or visible religious attributes. There are also more mundane things: in a market society people live in different ways and egalitarianism is not the norm. Hence it's probably not very nice when some kids come to school dressed very fashionably – to put it diplomatically – while others are dressed very modestly, again speaking diplomatically. After all, no one should feel like a second class citizen in such [school] environment. It would certainly be better if regions and municipalities were to consider introducing common standards for school clothes. There is nothing wrong about it. In my view, an obligatory uniform is a very good example of a practice that was conducted in the Soviet Union and is taking place now in neighbouring countries, and even in a very self-respecting and internationally recognised educational institutions, including universities. Is that a bad thing? No. On the contrary, it’s a tradition, and a good one. Now regarding the relationship between officials and the Popular Front. We should in no way bureaucratize the Popular Front. Still, it must use all available channels to communicate with various parties, including United Russia, and the executive authorities, while preventing anyone from imposing their will on the association. Through our direct communication we all know how it should be: you formulate what you consider to be the country’s most important challenges, and together we look for ways to address them. Of course many people will want to participate in this effort, but it must be a dynamic effort and people must join [the Popular Front] motivated for a dynamic and positive process, and not to solve personal or corporate issues. * * * Vladimir Putin: We need modern, democratic tools, mechanisms of interaction with various social strata and groups, and to ensure that these communication channels work in both directions. First, we created business associations, and some of their representatives are present here today. Work can proceed through them, because we maintain regular contacts with these public and business organisations. Virtually no important Government decisions or policies concerning economic development are adopted without their participation. But these are associations of entrepreneurs and their number may not grow forever since that would be counter-productive; it would simply be impossible to meet with all of them. This is the first thing. Next is the fact that, despite the threat posed by the increasing number of such organisations, we have recently created one more: the Agency for Strategic Initiatives (ASI), where a lot of young people participate. Within the Russian Popular Front we can and should devote enough attention to our economic development. But in my opinion, this should consist not so much of supporting some specific businesses, but rather setting general goals. We should structure such a communication mechanism which will allow us to hear the majority of people who work in each particular field so that we take their views into account. * * * Vladimir Putin: I think that this is one of the purposes of the Russian Popular Front: to prepare national solutions, solutions suitable to be deployed on a national scale, and of course to make a very important preliminary assessment of what policy might be adopted. Public opinion is very important for that. If we can arrange to get to know public opinion through the channels of the Russian Popular Front this will be very useful. * * * Vladimir Putin: Regarding pension reform, a very sensitive and very important issue, with both social and economic aspects. Of course it would be useful for us to discuss such things at a Popular Front meeting as well as elsewhere. But the Popular Front has not yet taken shape as a non-governmental organisation, and failing that it is difficult to identify all of the problems that our country faces. In that case we are to return to these formats, and then to form quite a professional so-called platform to discuss specific issues. Why? Because I understand that when it comes to rates and social taxes, especially taxes paid by hazardous industries, then if the burden on such businesses increases, businesses certainly do not like this. So within the Popular Front there should be a decision made based on both professional and public opinions, namely, if we protect the interests of the business community and do not raise taxes, then how are we going to support the growing number of pensioners in the future? Some people, including our opponents, say: ”There is only one way to finance this [social commitment], namely to increase the retirement age for both women and men“. This is a very sensitive issue, requiring accurate and professional approach. So within the Popular Front we could engage in a broad discussion and see that, yes, such and such a proposal comes from this community, and that one from a different social group, and this one from workers; so then we could bring all the ideas together and find a compromise which would not hamper the country's development while offering a sustainable, self-sufficing, efficient pension system, one that does not undermine the economy and guarantees citizens’ pension rights. * * * Vladimir Putin: We will not meet often, but we will do so regularly, especially if we are concerned with some issue involving how our activities are structured. Perhaps we shall meet to discuss certain topics. Then the discussions and the steps we take following our discussions will be even more specific, more effective, and have better chances of being implemented. But what we did up until now was also great because many things are being implemented, and some have been incorporated in major documents as programmes for immediate and strategic goals, which is very important for our country. I want to thank you for this.\", 'kremlin_id': 16680, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting with core members of the Russian Popular Front', 'teaser': \"Vladimir Putin and core members of the Russian Popular Front discussed the municipal and regional elections held on October 14 and the organisation's future development.\", 'tags': [], 'transcript_filtered': \"Good afternoon, friends, colleagues, I am very pleased that we have such a representative gathering today, including members of various public organisations, trade unions, political parties and youth movements. During the presidential election campaign and immediately afterwards we said that we must continue our efforts. There were many discussions about the objectives the RPF was created to pursue and whether it is just a campaign tool. Indeed, it did serve as a political campaign tool, but that was not its only purpose. My original understanding was that if we succeed in creating a broad public coalition, and that is exactly what the Popular Front has become, then it would simply be wrong and wasteful not to let it get involved in social processes. In fact, everything that has been done in Moscow and around the country was achieved with the direct involvement of work teams, the people, our citizens, and it is a very good feedback tool that lets us know what is being done and how successfully in different parts of the country. To begin with, I want to thank you: many of you present here took an active part in the preparation of the national development programme. You may have noticed that my first executive orders as President of the Russian Federation dated May 7, 2012 deal with many issues that you formulated. They are all identified there, and not just identified but the executive orders set the deadlines and outline the means we will use to address the challenges facing our country. This prompts a very simple and logical conclusion: if the people represented in the Russian Popular Front formulated the national development programme, then you should have the opportunity to oversee how the targets you have set are being met. This is a very important part of any political initiative, and so, as we agreed, I suggested that we meet to discuss what we can do in the future and in what format. The first task, which I talked about in the past and would like to go back to now, is control over the execution. The tasks themselves have been formalised in the plans and specific documents, including the Presidential executive orders, but we are all adults here – some of us are older, some younger, but we are all adults – and we understand that life is full of problems and surprises, and there is always need for adjustments. Therefore, as we implement any initiative, tackle any challenge facing the nation, there are always some details that we must respond to quickly but efficiently and competently. Therefore, the second task, which is directly linked to the first one, is to respond to everything that happens in real life, so that we can quickly make amendments, perhaps even change our plans and priorities. Many of you asked at our previous meetings: What should be the format of the Popular Front’s work?

I know that you have been in talks with one of Rosneft’s potential strategic partners. How is the work going and what are the results? Rosneft CEO and chairman of the Management Board Igor Sechin: Mr President, following on from your instructions on making Rosneft more effective, and from our recent meeting in Sochi at which we and BP briefed you on our plans, I want to inform you that we have just concluded the main talks on our cooperation with BP.  I can inform you now that we have signed an agreement on the terms and conditions of Rosneft’s acquisition of BP’s stake in Tyumen Oil Company (TNK). Vladimir Putin: What will happen with the Russian participant in the TNK-BP joint venture? Igor Sechin: We support the idea of consolidating this asset under one single management, and BP takes the same position. It is very important that this asset work according to a common plan with Rosneft, because only in this way can we achieve the level of synergy that will dramatically raise the performance of a number of both Rosneft’s and TNK’s deposits and refineries. I am talking about fields such as Suzun-Tagul and Verkhnechonsk, and the refinery group. In this respect we have been working closely with TNK’s private shareholders, the AAR Consortium, and have concluded a similar agreement on the acquisition with them too. Vladimir Putin: On the terms and conditions for acquisition of their stake? Igor Sechin: On the principles for acquisition of their stake on arm’s length terms similar to those we agreed on with BP. Mr President, let me add that we just received the news that this plan has just got official approval from BP, which had the right to either support the deal with AAR, or to refuse its support and turn to other procedures.  Just an hour ago, BP officially approved the deal with AAR, and so we can now begin the relevant procedures with this consortium. In the aim of optimising the financing structure of the deal with BP, we proposed that the settlement also takes into account the approximately 12.85-percent stake in Rosneft that will go to BP as part of the deal. Vladimir Putin: In other words, the Russian Federation Government’s plans on reducing state interest in companies in which the Russian Federation holds a controlling stake will be taken into account. Igor Sechin: Exactly, Mr President. We undertook this work in general upon your instruction, with the aim of obtaining a comprehensive result that would fulfil your objective of reducing the state’s interest and finding a strategic investor with the needed technology. One of the main elements of this deal was the offer we received from BP to buy a 5.66-percent stake in Rosneft from the state. This will thus give BP a consolidated stake of more than 19 percent of shares in Rosneft. Vladimir Putin: This sends an excellent signal to the Russian market and to the global energy market too, and is further evidence of the confidence our partners have in working on the Russian market. This is a good deal, a major deal of importance not just for the country’s energy sector but for the entire Russian economy.  I want to thank you for your work. I hope that you will succeed in building a good partnership with this foreign company, British Petroleum, which I hope will very soon become one of your biggest shareholders.  BP has been working in Russia for a long time now and with positive results, and I am sure that this deal will benefit our partners and benefit Rosneft, one of our sector leaders. I wish you success.  Igor Sechin: Thank you very much. Mr President, if you permit, I would like to address my thanks to everyone who worked on this deal, and to our partners from BP. This truly is a historic deal and we are grateful for your support. Without the support and attention you gave it, it would have been difficult to get everything done in such a short time. Let me assure you that the effort was worth it. This deal will make Rosneft the world’s biggest company in terms of liquid hydrocarbon production and in terms of reserves. Taking into account Rosneftegaz shares, the deal will be the third-biggest in the oil and gas sector to date, after the mergers of Exxon Mobil and Total–Elf. Counting Rosneftegaz shares, the deal is worth around $61 billion and is an acquisition of great significance, a complex deal, of course. We will complete the work on it. Vladimir Putin: I know that you have reached an agreement with our partners on the Rosneft share price. The price is good and even gives a small bonus. This sends out a good signal. I congratulate you and wish you success. Igor Sechin: Mr President, one of the biggest achievements to come out of this deal is that we succeeded in reaching an agreement that has obtained the support of appraisers, leading financial consultants, major global banks, and legal advisers. The Rosneft share price as approved for this deal under our agreement has been set at $8 per share.  <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16696, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting with Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin met with Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin.', 'tags': ['Energy'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, Mr Sechin.

Today, we will address once again one of the serious problems affecting our economy, one of the big social sector issues too, namely, the problem of the single-industry towns. Towns where life depends on one or two companies were particularly hard-hit by the recent crisis. I remind you that we were quite effective in our response then and created 190,000 temporary jobs and 60,000 permanent jobs. Overall, however, although unemployment is now at a record low of around 5.1 percent in total, and around 1.3 percent – around a million people – if we count only the registered unemployed, the situation in the single-industry towns is still worrying. I will not name the figures now, but the relevant government commission and the Economic Development Minister [Andrei Belousov], who have been working on this problem for quite some time now, along with all of our colleagues involved in this issue, know that the problems are still a long way from being completely resolved. We have around 300 of these single-industry towns and the problems are still quite serious. Vnesheconombank   Background information Vnesheconombank   , which we have got involved in working on these problems right from the start, during the crisis period, has developed around 40 job creation projects in these towns with total financing of 400 billion roubles.

At the same time, I want to draw attention to the fact that the situation in the global economy remains tense and uncertain. We know and understand where this unsettlement in the global economy can lead, how it reflects on national economies, including ours. So I would like to draw your attention to a few points. We need to continue keeping these issues under a constant control. And regardless of how much we are criticised for being too “hands-on,” this is the case when we need to work with each and every city individually, seeking out options for resolving problems and never forgetting that every dismissal from work affects the fate of individuals, the state of Russian families, children, and the material well-being of our citizens. We set the goal to create 25 million new high-tech jobs. And overall, we have been able to at least partially accomplish this goal during the crisis period.

Thank you for accepting the invitation and coming for this visit. There is no need to repeat what we all know about the immense scale of our cooperation, which is developing well in our political ties, in international affairs, and in the economy too. Our bilateral trade is growing and our ties continue to become more diversified. The deep level of cooperation between our companies is well known and I have already spoken about it. There are some companies in both countries that simply would not be able to work effectively without each other. I think your visit is timely. I am very pleased that we have these regular contacts, not just at the presidential level, but at the government and ministerial level too, and between our companies that work together. I am very happy to see you and wish you welcome. President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych     Yanukovych Viktor : Thank you, Mr President. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visited Ukraine last week on your instruction. Our ministers went over most of the issues that we will discuss today, and I imagine you have already been briefed. I have come of course in order to keep the gap between our contacts short, as longer gaps never bring any benefit, and to discuss and settle some of the current issues before us, many of which you just mentioned.  First, I want to say that our agencies have finally reached an agreement on cooperation in the space sector, on research and joint work, as we discussed, between Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Russia in this sector. Three launches are now being planned. I think this is an important and topical sector in terms of helping to spread use of modern technology that is a driving force of economic growth today. We should probably settle the situation in the aircraft manufacturing sector too, today, seeing as our manufacturers are waiting for our decisions in this area. In the nuclear energy sector the relevant companies are ready to begin their work, and after we make our joint decision we will be able to launch the new cooperation programmes between our countries in this sector. I also want to discuss current matters, our relations with the Customs Union, for example, because we still hold to our previous view and consider that deepening our cooperation with the Customs Union will benefit our goods producers. We should keep on steadily deepening these relations as this will only benefit the economy. Of course, I also want to congratulate you on your birthday. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Viktor Yanukovych: Let me tell you that nothing changes after 60. Everything continues and life looks even more beautiful.  Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for your congratulations and for the deep analysis of our relations. On the Customs Union, as we have discussed before, it is always up to each country to decide for itself whether to join this or that organisation. But given the depth of our cooperation, including in the key sectors you listed just now such as nuclear energy, the energy sector in general, aircraft manufacturing, space sector, shipbuilding, and other important sectors that characterise an economy’s level of technological development in general, not to mention joint scientific research and so on, we should analyse things in terms of a single comprehensive whole. You have to look too at the markets our countries work on. Ukrainian goods play an undisputed priority role in a number of sectors on the Russian market. You export a large share of your produce and a lot of aviation equipment to Russia. Almost all Russian helicopters are fitted with Ukrainian-made engines, for example. Viktor Yanukovych: Yes of course, from Motor Sich. Vladimir Putin: And there are other areas of cooperation in the aircraft-manufacturing sector too. This is all so important for future development of both economies that it is only natural to put in place special conditions for developing these cooperation ties. But this is a process of negotiations of course. I have been discussing it with my colleagues too, as you know, — with the President of Kazakhstan and with the President of Belarus. This is a reciprocal process and must go hand-in-hand with a deep analysis of our mutual interests, and take these interests into account.  We will discuss this today too. Viktor Yanukovych: And we will discuss the gas sector.

Our talks confirmed that the development of cooperation and partnership between Russia and Ukraine is our common, strategic choice. It is based, first and foremost, on the strong bonds of friendship between our peoples, and regardless of the political situation, there is no reasonable alternative to this course. This is clear in the example of Russian-Ukrainian economic ties: many sectors of our industry are interdependent and complementary, with thousands of companies and enterprises working directly within the production cooperation framework. Today, Ukraine is firmly in fourth place among Russia’s main foreign trade partners, and the first among CIS   Background information Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)    nations. Last year, our mutual trade turnover grew by 36 percent, surpassing $50 billion. We need to maintain and consolidate this trend. We discussed the additional reserves that can be used to achieve this and how to reduce our economies’ dependence on the complicated processes that are underway in the global economy, on global markets. Given the high degree of integration between our economies, we will work more actively on projects in areas where Russia and Ukraine are truly leaders. I am referring to nuclear energy, aircraft manufacturing, metallurgy and aerospace. A concrete step taken in this direction is the protocol signed today on the supply of goods within the production cooperation framework. It is about simplifying the procedures for reciprocal delivery of component parts, materials and equipment in sectors where we are building common production chains as much as possible. Broadening investment, trade and industrial ties would help to remove barriers hindering the movement of goods and services, capital and labour. So during the talks, we also touched on the important topic of Ukraine’s participation in integration processes underway in the CIS. Ukraine was one of the first nations to ratify the CIS Free Trade Zone Agreement. In doing so, we perceive Ukraine as a country with a pragmatic attitude toward strengthening and promoting cooperation and integration. We also discussed humanitarian issues. The Days of Education and Science of the Russian Federation were successfully held one month ago in Kiev. They included presentations of Russia’s leading universities, the latest achievements from Russian educators, and new educational programmes. There was a useful exchange of experience. Another important joint project will be the 200th anniversary of the birth of the great poet Taras Shevchenko in 2014. The President of Ukraine and I agreed to give instructions to our respective governments to begin joint all-around preparations for this anniversary, which is significant to both our nations. In conclusion, I would like to say the following: the parliamentary election campaign is wrapping up in Ukraine, and we sincerely hope that the elections to the Verkhovna Rada will ensure further steady democratic development of the brotherly Ukrainian nation. We hope that after the election, the course toward close cooperation between our nations will gain additional momentum. I would like to thank Mr Yanukovych and all our Ukrainian friends for their constructive approach to all the issues we discussed. President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych     Yanukovych Viktor : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, We just completed our bilateral talks. I feel that they were quite productive and were held, as always, in a trust-based and constructive environment, an atmosphere of complete mutual understanding. Mr Putin and I discussed nearly the full range of current issues in bilateral cooperation. We noted the enormous potential in Ukraine and Russia’s relations and how it is imperative to focus our efforts on using it to the fullest extent. In particular, it is especially important for our nations to further develop cooperation in areas where we already have good results, i.e., nuclear energy, aircraft manufacturing, aerospace, energy, and other high-tech, science-driven sectors. According to the results from last year, our nations have already surpassed pre-crisis figures in bilateral trade. But we won’t stop there, and we both believe that we should continue taking joint steps to progressively increase our bilateral turnover volume. Our common refusal to apply any restrictive measures in our mutual trade will help us in achieving this goal. We also gave significant attention to issues of bilateral cooperation in energy. In this regard, I would like to stress that we are continuing talks on the so-called gas issue, which is very relevant for Ukraine, and we expect to work out an economically sound, fair formula for establishing gas prices for our nation. Today’s meeting also confirmed mutual understanding of the fact that completing the contractual and legal formalisation of the Russian-Ukrainian state border must be accompanied by a set of measures allowing for the development of existing business contacts, as well as for free travel of citizens between Ukraine and Russia. I would also like to note that the President of Russia and I discussed our desire to maintain active political dialogue, particularly at the highest level. Thus, we had a concrete discussion of the possible schedule for our bilateral contacts in the near future. The success of the Ukrainian-Russian Interregional Economic Forum in Nizhny Novgorod is quite significant in the context of broadening our interregional cooperation. We specifically discussed preparations for this event, which has become a tradition and is held under the patronage of the Presidents of Russia and Ukraine. Today, we also signed two intergovernmental documents: the agreement on readmission and the protocol on the supply of production cooperation goods. Their implementation will help to intensify Ukrainian-Russian cooperation in two key areas: deepening near-border cooperation and strengthening direct trade and economic ties between the two nations’ enterprises. Overall, the results of today’s meeting have confirmed that both sides are committed to further dynamic development of bilateral relations based on strategic partnership.

Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller     Miller AlexeiGazprom CEO  reported on the launch of production at the gas field. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends, I want to welcome all those who have gathered in Yamal today, all those who took part in implementing this major, large-scale project in the Yamal Peninsula. Natural gas reserves at the Bovanenkovo field, which we are launching today, are enormous: they amount to 4.9 trillion cubic metres of gas. We are implementing a number of major projects this year, both in production and infrastructure, including the second leg of the Nord Stream pipeline and the South Stream project. These extensive programmes testify to the fact that Russia is a major producer of natural gas and a reliable supplier to the domestic and foreign markets. I want to thank everyone who played a part in the launch of the Bovanenkovo gas field. This work was done in very difficult climatic conditions and its success was ensured by our highly qualified professionals: workers, engineers and scientists. You have made a great contribution to the sector’s success, as well as the development of our national economy. It opens new horizons for the expansion of the domestic market and strengthens our export potential. Suffice it to say that 115 billion cubic metres of gas will be produced at the Bovanenkovo field every year, and this figure will rise to 140 billion cubic metres in the near future. This amounts to almost the entire volume of our exports to Europe (a little less, but nearly the entire volume). This is a tremendous amount. In fact, it is comparable to the amount of gas produced in the Soviet Union at the beginning of large-scale production. This event is on the same scale. The total reserves in Yamal will allow us to produce 340–360 billion cubic meters of gas by 2030. This is an enormous amount, and it will guarantee for decades ahead that we will be able to fulfil our obligations not only to our partners abroad, but also to supply gas on a large-scale to Russian cities, towns and villages. The new Bovanenkovo-Ukhta gas pipeline was built especially to supply gas to the Unified Gas Supply System of Russia. This technologically unique pipeline will carry gas from Yamal to the central regions of the Russian Federation. However, much remains to be done. In particular, it is important to continue the comprehensive development of gas fields in Yamal and the north of the Krasnoyarsk Territory. We plan to build a modern oil and gas region here, put into operation dozens of promising fields, link them with roads and gas pipelines and create thousands of new jobs. This is all possible and I'm sure it will be achieved. In addressing these issues, I count on responsible and concerted efforts of the federal and regional authorities, and gas sector companies. We will discuss these and other issues in this sphere at a meeting of the Commission for Strategic Development of the Fuel and Energy Sector and Environmental Security. In conclusion, I would like to thank once again the engineers, workers and everyone who worked at this gas field for their contribution to this challenging and vitally important project, which was implemented in accordance with the highest environmental standards. This is essential in regions such as Yamal and the Far North in general. I want to congratulate you once again on your great success and wish you all the best.

            "{'date': '2012-10-23T17:30:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': \"* * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, This is the second meeting of the Commission for Strategic Development of the Fuel and Energy Sector and Environmental Security. Our first meeting held in July 2012 showed that this is an interesting and useful format. We have a new venue for deep, multifaceted discussions of key, strategic matters pertaining to energy sector’s development. Our today’s agenda consists of three main issues. First, we will discuss the draft Doctrine of Russia's Energy Security, which was prepared by the Energy Ministry. This document aims to address a wide range of tasks, including ensuring a reliable supply of energy to consumers, innovative development of the fuel and energy sector, energy efficiency of all sectors of the Russian economy and non-discriminatory access of our exporters to foreign markets. Regular renewal of enterprises’ production assets and maintaining these assets in a safe and efficient condition are our unquestionable priorities. We will formulate strategic planning documents on the basis of the Doctrine and implement a long-term energy security policy. The Doctrine outlines a system of indicators for the assessment of key groups of internal and external risks. Today, we will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Doctrine’s provisions, and I think it should be adopted in November. In the future it will be necessary to monitor and assess the main indicators outlined in the Doctrine, thus ensuring control over the situation in the energy sector so that timely decisions are made on strengthening our country’s energy security. The second item on our agenda is also directly related to energy security and the long-term prospects of strengthening Russia's position in the global energy markets. I am talking about current production trends and the proactive response to these trends in production, processing and sale of natural gas, which we will talk about today. In recent years, we have seen a change in the energy market configuration. There is no need to explain this to you; you are all aware of the situation and understand what is happening. European countries, for example, are consistently working to create a common gas market. They are diversifying their sources of supply and adopting internal decisions that are not always coordinated with their main partners and are not always right, in my opinion, from the point of view of international law, but such decisions are made. We are in dialogue with our partners, and I hope that we will reach an acceptable consensus, but nevertheless we must consider these trends. There is tough competition among gas exporters for the long-term and short-term contracts. However, energy consumption is rapidly growing in the Asia-Pacific region: China, Japan, which has increased its share of hydrocarbons since the Fukushima tragedy, India, and Russia’s other eastern neighbours are large and promising consumers. Given the existing transport infrastructure in Russia, this opens up new opportunities for the exporters of domestic energy resources. Another important global trend is the growth of trade in liquefied natural gas. Such major players as US and Canadian companies have already begun to move in this direction. I would like to note that more and more countries are adopting new gas production and processing technologies. For example, in the United States, as you know, new technology is used to increase the cost-effectiveness of shale gas production. That has caused some serious environmental problems, but, nevertheless, the technology continues to be used. The sale of the by-products makes it profitable even given the low domestic prices in the United States. Politicians, experts and the business community are all talking about a shale revolution. In 2011, according to our data, the output of shale gas in the United States rose to 214 billion cubic metres. All of us know this well; we are not novices on the gas market and understand its laws. Therefore, we must be very prudent in our actions and at the same time very flexible. In this regard, I ask Gazprom to conduct the necessary analysis and report to the Commission on the main principles of its gas export policy. The Commission must be briefed on the way the principal Russian gas company is planning to organise this work because a great deal in the Russian economy depends on its effectiveness. The Energy Ministry must make adjustments to the gas industry development plan to 2030 and our Eastern Gas Programme, and report on the results to the Commission. Our priority, and I want to stress this, must be the domestic market, meeting the needs of the Russian economy, businesses and consumers, deep processing of raw materials, the development of gas chemistry and the maximum use of all gas components and by-products, as well as market diversification, taking into account the potential of Asian countries, as I have mentioned, and gas delivery methods. An important area that will dominate in the future is the development of domestic gas processing and its use in the production of motor fuel. Gazprom should incorporate a special subsidiary [for that purpose] in the near future, or, perhaps, it has already been incorporated, and in that case we must support it in every way. Despite the measures that are already being taken, much of associated gas continues to be wasted. About a quarter of the volume produced is simply burnt off: that is 24.6%, or 16.2 billion cubic metres. This is more than the total consumption of some European countries in a year. Let me reiterate: we must take full account of the current trends in the global gas market in cooperation with our international partners, to find new mutually acceptable forms of cooperation, to be closer to the end users. Taken together, these steps will increase the export potential and competitiveness of Russian energy resources and enhance the status of our country as one of the leaders in the global export market. Finally, the third item on our agenda is cooperation with the European Union, our closest partner and major consumer, in the electricity sector. Russia has traditionally supplied large amounts of electricity to EU countries. First of all, this applies to our closest neighbours, Scandinavia and the Baltic region. Thus, in 2011 we exported about 5.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity to the Baltic States. This is more than half of the total energy consumed by a country like Lithuania, and meets more than 20% of the total consumption of the Baltic States. Importantly, electricity from Russia is supplied to our partners without any interruptions even in the winter periods of peak demand. Today it is essential to consolidate the principles of intergovernmental cooperation in the energy sector with the EU countries and the EU as a whole, to develop a set of measures that will improve the competitiveness of the Russian electricity sector, and not only to keep our traditional markets, but also to expand to new markets in the near future. Colleagues, today I would like to hear your proposals on priority steps in all these areas. Thank you very much for your attention.

We are holding the first meeting of the Council for Economic Modernisation and Innovative Development today. We had several government and presidential commissions and decided to unite them under this one umbrella. This is our first meeting. There is no need to argue the importance of modernisation for Russia’s successful development. It is the refrain running through all of our documents and meetings and is indeed the general line for developing our economy, strengthening its place in the global economy, and creating the conditions for our people’s self-realisation. The pace of innovative development around the world is growing all the time and spreading to an ever larger number of countries. The old principle that saw developing countries actively using outdated technology no longer holds true. We see this for ourselves. All of the fast-growing countries are putting the emphasis on developing sectors at the cutting edge of technology, future-focused sectors.  Russia can use this approach to diversify its exports, preserve and consolidate positions on its domestic market, and strengthen Russian companies’ place in the market.  It is clear that only economic modernisation and development of innovative sectors will enable us to realise our full potential in education and science and use their fruits to develop productive sectors that create significant added value and quality jobs. Many specialists take the view that new technology will play a major part in overcoming stagnation and instability throughout the global economy. History shows that overcoming a deep and lengthy crisis such as the one we are experiencing usually goes hand-in-hand with change of technologies, technology paradigms, and the emergence of new sectors and leaders in advanced technology and existing industries. New countries also emerge to take their place among the leaders, with the advantage going to those who have succeeded in riding the new technology wave. Our Council’s work should focus on these objectives. To reach these goals we will have to work in several different areas at once. First, we will continue to improve our institutions and develop a comprehensive environment for modernisation, innovative development, and commercialising the products of innovation. Second, we will draw up action plans for specific economic sectors, with a particular focus on bio- and nanotechnology, modern materials, future medicine, energy saving, information, space, and nuclear technology, and effective technology for extracting and processing hydrocarbons and other raw materials. We have already made steps in these areas. First, we set up a system of development institutions: the Russian Venture Company, RUSNANO, the Russian Foundation for Technological Development, Skolkovo, Vnesheconombank   Background information Vnesheconombank   , and the Fund for Facilitating Small Business Development in Science and Technology. This system aims to create an innovation lift that will cover the entire investment cycle and raise capital for innovative projects at every level, from start-ups to portfolio and strategic investment. Second, we have introduced new innovation development policy instruments. While perhaps not so new really, these measures are novelties in our country. I am referring to instruments such as tax breaks for innovative companies and the possibility of setting up small innovative businesses based at universities and research institutes. Incidentally, we already have close to 2,000 such small enterprises working now – 1,715 new innovative companies. The 14-percent preferential rate for employers’ compulsory insurance payments is also much lower than for other types of business. There are technology platforms in operation now to coordinate the activities of business, education and research institutions, and state agencies. Thirty such technology platforms have been approved. I hope that this area will develop and that we will see its results. The most active of the platforms so far is the one working in the health sector, on future medicine. We will have to expand the others’ activities too. Third, our big state-owned companies have put together innovative development programmes that commit them to investing more in science and increasing their cooperation with universities. We are to make sure these programmes are implemented now. Fourth, we have attracted a large number of scientists and businesspeople to invention and development activity. We have set up 115 technology transfer centres and 177 business incubators, and have selected 25 innovative clusters around the country that will receive state support for carrying out development programmes. Universities, institutes, and the Russian Academy of Sciences are establishing their own innovation centres, including with participation from foreign corporations. Along with improving the institutional environment, the authorities have also supported specific innovation projects within the framework of the five technological development priority areas. There are a total of 37 such projects, with financing from the federal budget coming to around 100 billion rubles [$3 billion] over 2010–2012. Of course, one cannot expect immediate returns in the innovative sector, and no one has such expectations, but it is important to maintain the pace and keep on track, continue our efforts. Today, we will analyse the situation in a sector that in other countries has become a powerful catalyst for the technology revolution, namely, the composite materials industry. There is demand for these materials in practically every sector, from construction, including housing construction, to the defence industry. If we do not succeed in developing this sector we will risk seeing many other sectors lose their competitiveness. This is a sector that gives us the chance to make big advances. But the Russian composite materials industry is still in the process of formation and we will have to solve quite a few problems here. The sector is in the process of development, but this is coming after the collapse of the Soviet composite materials sector. Although the sector was in its early days then, we were nonetheless among the world leaders, following the USA and Japan. Russia’s share of the market is now only 0.3–0.5 percent. It is hard to believe just how fast the sector was stripped of everything and fell apart. We do not have enough Russian-made equipment for producing composite materials, and enough modern testing centres. A lot of work should be done on updating the regulations and standards for these materials. Furthermore, we are to establish inter-sectoral engineering centres and train specialists to work in this sector. I think the state authorities can take measures to stimulate demand for these materials. More so, without incentives, private companies will not enter the sector but will remain in oil, gas, and metals, go wherever there is a decent profit to be made. They will not enter this sector without encouragement from the state. As for state financing, it will never be enough on its own, and should take various forms, including wide use of lifecycle contracts. I propose that we discuss the measures we can take to develop this sector in the immediate and longer-term future. The second issue on our agenda is commercialising the results of research and development activities. As you know, most orders for research and development work come from the state, and the resulting intellectual property rights belong to the Russian Federation, which would seem to be a fair enough system overall. But in most cases the results of this work grow dusty on the shelves and do not enter economic circulation. Research and development results could be used to create new products, technology, and jobs, and broaden the tax base. Instead, we have a situation in which the state spends considerable amounts of money and ends up with only direct losses and formal reports on the work done. The companies have no incentive to be inventive and rationalise their work, the quality of patents and licensing activity falls, and a number of companies have completely closed down their activities in this area. The current legal framework does not contain a unified approach to registration and exercise of intellectual property rights resulting from research and development work, and the research organisations and companies have little interest in including them in their accounting and reporting. The state customers practically never carry out inventories and cost estimates of research and development results, including when liquidating, reorganising, and privatising state-owned enterprises. The authors of new research and development work have no incentive to bring the results of their work into the public sphere and more often undertake registration for formal reasons such as submitting reports to the order-giver, or obtaining patents for thesis defences. In one technical university that is a leader in terms of the number of patents, for example, there are only 7 cases of licensed sales for 1,500 patents issued. The vast majority of research and development intellectual property rights are not fixed in any way at the moment, neither openly through patents, nor in closed fashion as know-how kept under commercial secret. All of this negatively affects companies’ investment attractiveness, holds back innovative development in industry, and contributes to the illegal outflow of science and technology products to other countries. I think the list of cases in which property rights over the fruit of research and development work go to the state could be reduced. What’s more, in order to encourage wider use of the results of this work, we should not limit ourselves to state contracts alone but should make more active use of other financing mechanisms too. Grants are the most widely-used financing mechanism around the world, but we are not making broad enough use of them here yet. I discussed this matter just yesterday with the Finance Minister [Anton Siluanov]. I hope we will make progress in this area and take practical steps forward. We should take the legislative and organisational decisions that will encourage greater use of grants. We also are to put in place the laws making it possible for the state to transfer rights to the results of research and development work to interested development organisations, investors, and economic actors. This of course applies to research and development work not connected to Russia’s defence and security. We must not take the approach of ‘if I can’t have it, no one will’. We do not even really have any results to speak of for now, or only modest ones. In short, we need to fill in the legislative gaps concerning registration and exercise of rights to research and development results. We must ultimately establish a system that will protect intellectual property and be attractive for investors. I want to note one more point in conclusion. We have to change the investment and business climate in order to transform our economic structure and encourage rapid development of the non-raw materials, high-tech sectors. We have spoken a lot about this lately. I have said in my speeches, and the government has said too, that we must take our place among the top twenty countries with best environments for doing business. The World Bank published its latest rating on conditions for doing business yesterday, and Russia has moved up eight places, from 120 to 112. We still have a long way to go, but at least the trend is positive, and we should continue in this direction. Our progress in areas such as ‘convenience of tax administration’ and ‘conditions for starting business’ is particularly good to see. As far as convenience of tax administration goes, I think we even came out ahead of countries such as the United States. I note too, that the new rating has not yet taken into account the results of work on the roadmaps for improving the investment climate. The progress we have achieved in particular areas shows that we are entirely capable of achieving quality improvements in our business climate. The main thing is to take comprehensive and consistent action. We used to have an honorary title – Honoured Inventor of the Russian Federation. I will sign an executive order today returning this title. I hope it will serve as an added moral incentive for work in the area we are discussing today. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16708, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting of the Council for Economic Modernisation and Innovative Development', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin held the first meeting of the Council for Economic Modernisation and Innovative Development, which was established in June this year.', 'tags': ['Economy and finance', 'Industry', 'Science and innovation'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, colleagues. We are holding the first meeting of the Council for Economic Modernisation and Innovative Development today. We had several government and presidential commissions and decided to unite them under this one umbrella. This is our first meeting. There is no need to argue the importance of modernisation for Russia’s successful development. It is the refrain running through all of our documents and meetings and is indeed the general line for developing our economy, strengthening its place in the global economy, and creating the conditions for our people’s self-realisation. The pace of innovative development around the world is growing all the time and spreading to an ever larger number of countries. The old principle that saw developing countries actively using outdated technology no longer holds true. We see this for ourselves. All of the fast-growing countries are putting the emphasis on developing sectors at the cutting edge of technology, future-focused sectors.  Russia can use this approach to diversify its exports, preserve and consolidate positions on its domestic market, and strengthen Russian companies’ place in the market.  It is clear that only economic modernisation and development of innovative sectors will enable us to realise our full potential in education and science and use their fruits to develop productive sectors that create significant added value and quality jobs. Many specialists take the view that new technology will play a major part in overcoming stagnation and instability throughout the global economy. History shows that overcoming a deep and lengthy crisis such as the one we are experiencing usually goes hand-in-hand with change of technologies, technology paradigms, and the emergence of new sectors and leaders in advanced technology and existing industries. New countries also emerge to take their place among the leaders, with the advantage going to those who have succeeded in riding the new technology wave. Our Council’s work should focus on these objectives. To reach these goals we will have to work in several different areas at once. First, we will continue to improve our institutions and develop a comprehensive environment for modernisation, innovative development, and commercialising the products of innovation. Second, we will draw up action plans for specific economic sectors, with a particular focus on bio- and nanotechnology, modern materials, future medicine, energy saving, information, space, and nuclear technology, and effective technology for extracting and processing hydrocarbons and other raw materials. We have already made steps in these areas. First, we set up a system of development institutions: the Russian Venture Company, RUSNANO, the Russian Foundation for Technological Development, Skolkovo, Vnesheconombank   Background information Vnesheconombank   , and the Fund for Facilitating Small Business Development in Science and Technology. This system aims to create an innovation lift that will cover the entire investment cycle and raise capital for innovative projects at every level, from start-ups to portfolio and strategic investment. Second, we have introduced new innovation development policy instruments. While perhaps not so new really, these measures are novelties in our country. I am referring to instruments such as tax breaks for innovative companies and the possibility of setting up small innovative businesses based at universities and research institutes. Incidentally, we already have close to 2,000 such small enterprises working now – 1,715 new innovative companies. The 14-percent preferential rate for employers’ compulsory insurance payments is also much lower than for other types of business. There are technology platforms in operation now to coordinate the activities of business, education and research institutions, and state agencies. Thirty such technology platforms have been approved. I hope that this area will develop and that we will see its results. The most active of the platforms so far is the one working in the health sector, on future medicine. We will have to expand the others’ activities too. Third, our big state-owned companies have put together innovative development programmes that commit them to investing more in science and increasing their cooperation with universities. We are to make sure these programmes are implemented now. Fourth, we have attracted a large number of scientists and businesspeople to invention and development activity. We have set up 115 technology transfer centres and 177 business incubators, and have selected 25 innovative clusters around the country that will receive state support for carrying out development programmes. Universities, institutes, and the Russian Academy of Sciences are establishing their own innovation centres, including with participation from foreign corporations. Along with improving the institutional environment, the authorities have also supported specific innovation projects within the framework of the five technological development priority areas. There are a total of 37 such projects, with financing from the federal budget coming to around 100 billion rubles [$3 billion] over 2010–2012. Of course, one cannot expect immediate returns in the innovative sector, and no one has such expectations, but it is important to maintain the pace and keep on track, continue our efforts. Today, we will analyse the situation in a sector that in other countries has become a powerful catalyst for the technology revolution, namely, the composite materials industry. There is demand for these materials in practically every sector, from construction, including housing construction, to the defence industry. If we do not succeed in developing this sector we will risk seeing many other sectors lose their competitiveness. This is a sector that gives us the chance to make big advances. But the Russian composite materials industry is still in the process of formation and we will have to solve quite a few problems here. The sector is in the process of development, but this is coming after the collapse of the Soviet composite materials sector. Although the sector was in its early days then, we were nonetheless among the world leaders, following the USA and Japan. Russia’s share of the market is now only 0.3–0.5 percent. It is hard to believe just how fast the sector was stripped of everything and fell apart. We do not have enough Russian-made equipment for producing composite materials, and enough modern testing centres. A lot of work should be done on updating the regulations and standards for these materials. Furthermore, we are to establish inter-sectoral engineering centres and train specialists to work in this sector. I think the state authorities can take measures to stimulate demand for these materials. More so, without incentives, private companies will not enter the sector but will remain in oil, gas, and metals, go wherever there is a decent profit to be made. They will not enter this sector without encouragement from the state. As for state financing, it will never be enough on its own, and should take various forms, including wide use of lifecycle contracts. I propose that we discuss the measures we can take to develop this sector in the immediate and longer-term future. The second issue on our agenda is commercialising the results of research and development activities. As you know, most orders for research and development work come from the state, and the resulting intellectual property rights belong to the Russian Federation, which would seem to be a fair enough system overall. But in most cases the results of this work grow dusty on the shelves and do not enter economic circulation. Research and development results could be used to create new products, technology, and jobs, and broaden the tax base. Instead, we have a situation in which the state spends considerable amounts of money and ends up with only direct losses and formal reports on the work done. The companies have no incentive to be inventive and rationalise their work, the quality of patents and licensing activity falls, and a number of companies have completely closed down their activities in this area. The current legal framework does not contain a unified approach to registration and exercise of intellectual property rights resulting from research and development work, and the research organisations and companies have little interest in including them in their accounting and reporting. The state customers practically never carry out inventories and cost estimates of research and development results, including when liquidating, reorganising, and privatising state-owned enterprises. The authors of new research and development work have no incentive to bring the results of their work into the public sphere and more often undertake registration for formal reasons such as submitting reports to the order-giver, or obtaining patents for thesis defences. In one technical university that is a leader in terms of the number of patents, for example, there are only 7 cases of licensed sales for 1,500 patents issued. The vast majority of research and development intellectual property rights are not fixed in any way at the moment, neither openly through patents, nor in closed fashion as know-how kept under commercial secret. All of this negatively affects companies’ investment attractiveness, holds back innovative development in industry, and contributes to the illegal outflow of science and technology products to other countries. I think the list of cases in which property rights over the fruit of research and development work go to the state could be reduced. What’s more, in order to encourage wider use of the results of this work, we should not limit ourselves to state contracts alone but should make more active use of other financing mechanisms too. Grants are the most widely-used financing mechanism around the world, but we are not making broad enough use of them here yet. I discussed this matter just yesterday with the Finance Minister [Anton Siluanov]. I hope we will make progress in this area and take practical steps forward. We should take the legislative and organisational decisions that will encourage greater use of grants. We also are to put in place the laws making it possible for the state to transfer rights to the results of research and development work to interested development organisations, investors, and economic actors. This of course applies to research and development work not connected to Russia’s defence and security. We must not take the approach of ‘if I can’t have it, no one will’. We do not even really have any results to speak of for now, or only modest ones. In short, we need to fill in the legislative gaps concerning registration and exercise of rights to research and development results. We must ultimately establish a system that will protect intellectual property and be attractive for investors. I want to note one more point in conclusion. We have to change the investment and business climate in order to transform our economic structure and encourage rapid development of the non-raw materials, high-tech sectors. We have spoken a lot about this lately. I have said in my speeches, and the government has said too, that we must take our place among the top twenty countries with best environments for doing business. The World Bank published its latest rating on conditions for doing business yesterday, and Russia has moved up eight places, from 120 to 112. We still have a long way to go, but at least the trend is positive, and we should continue in this direction. Our progress in areas such as ‘convenience of tax administration’ and ‘conditions for starting business’ is particularly good to see. As far as convenience of tax administration goes, I think we even came out ahead of countries such as the United States. I note too, that the new rating has not yet taken into account the results of work on the roadmaps for improving the investment climate.

The main thing is to take comprehensive and consistent action. We used to have an honorary title – Honoured Inventor of the Russian Federation.

I hope it will serve as an added moral incentive for work in the area we are discussing today. <…>', 'wordlist': ['good', 'afternoon', ',', 'colleague', '.', ' ', 'we', 'be', 'hold', 'the', 'first',

The people of South Ossetia remember the important decisions made in August 2008. Those decisions, as well as the establishment of diplomatic ties, became steps, milestones in the history of the Ossetian people and in the history of Ossetian-Russian relations, which truly have serious historic roots. Today, our people are set on working constructively and we are maintaining that positive attitude thanks to your support, the support of the Russian Federation. I assure you that this positive attitude will remain and all the challenges before our people will be resolved, and the help granted by Russia will be delivered and will reach every individual, every family. It is a great honour for me to be here. We are meeting for the second time and I think we really will have enough time to discuss the issues that have accumulated and await our decision-making.

As before, we will continue to promote fostering conditions for raising living standards through the creation of new jobs and the rebuilding of the republic’s infrastructure.

Thank you very much. President of South Ossetia Leonid Tibilov     Tibilov Leonid : Thank you. Mr Putin, colleagues, We have just concluded our meeting at the highest level. This meeting has enormous political significance to the entire people of South Ossetia. This was my second meeting at this level. Our last meeting, held in May of this year, contributed to advancing the entire spectrum of relations between South Ossetia and Russia. Today we see that the agreements reached back in May are being implemented. Today’s meeting was very important. We discussed a range of issues of vital significance for the Republic of South Ossetia. We discussed economic matters and very thoroughly focused on the investment programme, which includes prospects for South Ossetia’s development. We agreed that this investment programme will be implemented in 2013–2015. I believe that once the programme is accomplished, the people of South Ossetia will feel the positive changes. I am grateful to Mr Putin, Russia’s leaders and all the people of Russia for the assistance that they have always provided and continue to provide to South Ossetia and its people. For our part, we know that the extensive aid coming from Russia will be rightly directed toward its intended recipients and that the life of every individual and every family will soon improve. We have always followed the legacy of our ancestors who declared friendship with Russia for all times. This fundamental principle will always be followed. The positive attitude within the republic’s leadership and among the people will be preserved in order to address various issues of our bilateral relations. Mr Putin, I want to once again sincerely thank you, and on behalf of our delegation and our people I want to take this opportunity to invite you to visit our republic at a time that is convenient for you. I believe that this would be an event that would be impossible to compare with anything else. So we are asking you to come and see how our people are living, even though you certainly have sufficient information on the subject, and to see the changes brought about by the new leadership of the Republic. Thank you very much, everyone. We hope for success in the development of our relations.

I suggest we just enjoy our dinner, we are going to have some wonderful wine and good food. But if some questions arise that still remain unclear, I will do my best to answer them. I say “do my best” because you have met with ministers and representatives of major companies. Each of them is an expert in his or her field, whereas I focus on the bigger picture, if you like. But, I repeat, if something remains unclear, I will try to satisfy your curiosity as far as I can. In any case, I would like to say at the beginning of our conversation that we highly value (and I personally truly appreciate) our regular annual meetings. I am very pleased that the international expert community still retains a keen interest in Russia, and I am glad that such esteemed experts on our country as those represented here can state Russia’s objective position in a timely manner, and interpret it with full knowledge of what is really happening in the Russian Federation. There are few people, other than Russians themselves, who understand it. Therefore, I am at your disposal. I am very glad to see you. Welcome, and enjoy your meal. Russian News and Information Agency Ria Novosti Editor-In-Chief Svetlana Mironyuk: Mr President, can I take over for a while? Do I have your permission? Mr President, colleagues, This is our ninth meeting. The club’s 10th anniversary is approaching. Next year we will hold our anniversary conference. This year the club has worked on a scenario of Russia’s economic development under the slogan The Future is Being Made Today. And, as Financial Times wrote today, we have made some changes to the format of our work in the course of the year (i.e., how the discussion club works over the course of the year) and we would like to invite you to change the format of our conversations and discussions and to move on from the usual Q&A format that we have every year to a slightly more structured discussion. I would like to present three of my co-hosts. They are well-known Valdai old timers Toby Gati, Alexander Rahr and Piotr Dutkiewicz. We would like to take a traditional Russian approach and divide our discussion into three sections: What is happening, Who is to blame, and What is to do be done. Vladimir Putin: In Russia no one is ever to blame. Svetlana Mironyuk: Just a few words about the club’s activities in between our annual meetings. The grant system has begun to operate and some eleven studies are being conducted by Russian and international experts and political scientists on a variety of topics, from Russia’s role in the global nuclear power industry to Russia’s image on non-Russian websites or the political aspects of developing the Arctic. All of these issues are very important, topical and interesting for both Russian and international audiences. Over the course of the year, the club’s members gather for the so-called mini-Valdai conferences and produce thematic reports, which I have brought here. Following this conference, a report will be published on scenarios of Russia’s economic development. It will be the basis for the discussion on the theme Russia at the Davos Forum. This shows that the club’s expertise is recognised at other venues. I would like to cite a few figures. This year's conference features 90 people from 20 countries, 35 of whom are experts from Russia and the rest are our foreign colleagues. We have around 20 new members, including from countries that were not represented previously, such as Belgium, Finland and Mexico, and the representation of our colleagues from China and India has increased significantly. That is all I wanted to say. I give the floor to Alexander Rahr. SENIOR ADVISOR ON RUSSIA FOR WINTERSHALL HOLDING, CONSULTANT FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE GERMAN-RUSSIAN CHAMBER OF FOREIGN COMMERCE (GERMANY) ALEXANDER RAHR: Mr President, first of all I would like to wish you a happy birthday. Sixty is a round number. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Alexander Rahr: We have discussed the global economic crisis in some detail and concluded that its development is not following a U or W trajectory, as we all expected, but that it is L-shaped; that is, the situation is getting worse. Global institutions are not working and it seems that they need to be changed. The best example is the European Union, which is being rebuilt more radically than ever before in the past 60 years. We can see that your policies have led Russia out of the gravest crisis of the 1990s. Ten years later, Russia is making a more or less successful recovery from the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the Valdai Club conference has noted that institutions in Russia are not working well either, and we devoted a great deal of time to this matter. Experts believe that Russia has been lucky thanks to its fuel and energy complex. I would like to begin our discussion with a general question that at least 20 people wanted to ask you: What is your current vision of Russia’s energy policy and global trends in the world? In this context, if you could comment on the consolidation of the Russian oil market through Rosneft, through the events surrounding Rosneft and the adaptation of Gazprom to the new realities of the gas market. Here we should probably talk about the fact that gas demand has been falling on the whole in Europe while new sources are appearing in America. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: If we speak at length on the subject raised by Mr Rahr, we won’t be able to talk about anything else. You can start and finish with it. So I’ll try to be brief. First of all, about how we are lucky or unlucky because of our hydrocarbons and other mineral resources. Some believe that the Soviet Union’s economic development began to stall when it started to produce vast quantities of oil. When there was a lot of oil, it became cheap while oil and gas revenues grew, and the Soviet economy lost the impetus for development. It was all there anyway, these riches fell down from the sky or rather came from underground. This is partly true. However, it is true only in part because the main problem was the non-market nature of the Soviet economy, the lack of competition and so on. A large amount of cheap mineral resources only aggravated the situation. As for modern Russia, it is a challenge we face as well. The challenge is the temptation of cheap mineral resources, which we have in abundance. This is true. But that is why we are making efforts to diversify the Russian economy. We talk a lot about it and I’m sure you discussed it with my colleagues, the ministers, with whom you met. Do these efforts bring about any positive changes? I think they do. Of course, 50 percent of our budget revenue comes from oil and gas sales. But if we take it as a percentage of our overall GDP, the oil-and-gas sector revenue is declining. And we plan for this revenue to drop even further against the GDP total. We believe that this extensive economic development model, which is based on mineral resources, has largely worked itself out. But naturally, if prices remain high enough, it would make no sense for us to sell our raw materials below world prices. That would simply be absurd. And if we sell them based on the higher global prices, the federal budget will get higher revenues from those resources accordingly. This is obvious. But given that we need to be thrifty and stimulate the economy as well as various sectors toward diversification, what are we doing? First of all, we are implementing stimulating measures. For example, we are introducing tax incentives for high-tech companies. And overall, they generally work quite efficiently. As you know, the tax component for workers and their salaries is very important for this sector of the economy, and the tax rate for small innovative enterprises in this sector is much lower than in other sectors of the economy. This is just one of the examples, one of the measures. At the same time, we are reducing budgetary expenditures that are financed out of oil-and-gas sector revenue. We implemented this for the first time, as we discussed last year, and beginning next year, we will be implementing the so-called budget rule, which we will use to calculate the average oil price for the past few years and, based on that price, plan our budget revenues and expenditures. Currently, as you know, the average price of our Urals blend is $111 per barrel. We take the next year’s oil price at around $104 per barrel, but applying the budget rule, we will only take into account that part of budget revenue that corresponds to the oil price of $91 per barrel. The planned budget expenditures would not result in a deficit if the oil price is $104 per barrel, so we are planning on having a slight deficit and feel it is justified. And most importantly, we have sources of financing if that deficit does occur. I will point out that last year and this year, we also planned on having a slight deficit. Last year, we ended up with a surplus of 0.8 percent, and this year, we have also had a surplus for the January-August period, and are likely to have a surplus at the end of the year as well. Nevertheless, we will calculate our expenditures based on oil price of $91 per barrel in 2013, $92 per barrel in 2014 and $93 per barrel in 2015. Overall, we will be very careful, and when we reduce our revenue and, accordingly, our expenditures, this spurs all the other sectors to be much more efficient. Moreover, we have adopted a whole programme on energy efficiency and the development of nanotechnology. We are taking separate stimulating measures to develop the aviation sector, the aerospace sector, and biomedicine. We have a separate programme with an allotment of, I’m not sure but I believe 120 billion rubles, to develop medical equipment and the pharmaceutical industry. We are taking a broad approach, creating infrastructural incentives in the form of tax breaks and giving additional resources for the development of promising high-tech sectors. We expect that we will be able to diversify the nation’s economy. Alexander Rahr: And Rosneft? Vladimir Putin: Rosneft. It is true that the Cabinet and I had mixed feelings when this project came up, specifically Rosneft’s purchase of BP’s interest. Indeed, the project began from that point, rather than the purchase of interest in TNK, i.e. the Russian stake. What was the cause of these mixed feelings? I will answer this very honestly. First, what did we consider as the downsides? The fact that a company with mainly state participation was increasing its presence on the market through a foreign partner. There was concern that the second part, i.e. the Russian part of TNK, could also be absorbed by Rosneft, a state company. And overall, that does not correspond to our trend of curbing government sector growth. But there was also another component (and the overwhelming majority of the experts present here know this): the fact that there was absolutely no unity between TNK-BP members; instead, there was a constant conflict lasting many years that occasionally came to blows. And I once warned that this was not a functional structure, when former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair and I attended the signing of the documents establishing this joint company (they did it on a “fifty-fifty” basis). Even then, I stated that the Russian Government and I would not object if our foreign partner were to hold controlling stakes. Just as we would be happy if the Russian side received the controlling stakes. There must be somebody to manage the company. They told me, “No, we will come to an agreement, we will settle this all amongst ourselves.” Well, they didn’t come to an agreement! They didn’t settle it! And all of their work was advancing from conflict to conflict. The foreign partner – the BP company – has turned to us many times for help. We tried not to get involved in their corporate disputes, but when BP came to the Cabinet, the BP executives came to me and said that they would like to cooperate with Rosneft (and this is the second part I wanted to talk about), we could not say “no” to them because otherwise, it would be perceived as if we were putting them in the same category as TNK, with which they have a constant conflict. We had a difficult choice to make. But ultimately, we nevertheless agreed with Rosneft and BP’s suggestion, their joint suggestion that they could work together. As for the second part, the possible sale of the second part of TNK to Rosneft, this would be an initiative that should come from TNK shareholders themselves; they have expressed their desire to sell their part as well. And the third component is that this is not just a purchase and sale deal, but also an exchange of shares, including both shares that belonged to Rosneft itself as well as, I believe, a 5.7 percent stake in Rosneft held by the state. And that is basically a part of our strategic plans; this is pretty much a privatisation, allowing a private foreign company into a Russian state company. At the same time, they, our partners from the UK, are taking on a fairly big stake, I can’t recall right now the exact figure, but I think this information is freely available. In any case, it gives them the opportunity to have a representative on the board of directors, which is a separate issue. At any rate, I am assuming that if there is a representative from a major shareholder on the board of directors, this will ensure additional transparency in activities of our biggest oil company, Rosneft, which incidentally is the world’s biggest crude oil producer. In terms of overall production volumes, including oil products, ExxonMobil is much bigger, but when it comes to crude oil production, Rosneft has taken first place worldwide. Alexander Rahr: Thank you. At the conference, we also discussed how perhaps Europe is suffering from a kind of schizophrenia. There is a part of Europe that wants to cooperate with Russia very closely, while the other one does not. Why is that? I would like to pass this question to former Prime Minister of Poland, Mr Oleksy. DEAN OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT AT ACADEMY OF FINANCE AND FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND JOZEF OLEKSY: Mr President, We have talked at length over the last four days about the crisis in the European Union and Russia’s attitude toward it. Could you please share your thoughts on overcoming this crisis? My second question is whether you feel it would be possible for Russia to enter the European Union, since you spoke about the issue of Russia’s accession to NATO, but those are two different things. And a third question. Would you be so kind as to compare your concept of the Eurasian Union with the European Union model? We feel that the European Union is at least partially a model for the Eurasian initiative. Can you talk about the long-term goals of this Eurasian Union? Because without Ukraine, for example, it will not be a strong organisation. Without an independent currency like the euro it would also be difficult to talk about economic coordination and joint economic policy. These are the three questions I would like to ask you. Vladimir Putin: First, as far as the crisis in Europe is concerned, this is ultimately not our problem. I feel that it wouldn’t even be entirely right for me to comment on all of this, because I have a great deal of respect for my European colleagues. They are facing extremely difficult economic, social and political challenges, and I do not really want to throw in my own comments which, one way or another, might put some sort of pressure on them. I can only repeat what I have said at international meetings, and our position is publicly known, so I will not go into details. I will say the following. Naturally, what we are seeing now in Europe is a systemic crisis, and it is not caused by debt alone. I think the problem goes far deeper. It is partially political in nature, partially technological, and partially pertains to problems with the integration process itself. As for its political nature, I think it’s on the surface. To paraphrase Churchill, the current system of power is a terrible system, but it’s the best we’ve got. Where does it lead to in practice? We all understand that. A party striving for power, promising everything unsparingly. That is the nature of today’s civilised world. They keep making promises, and then try to fulfil some of them. If they don’t, that’s it; they stand almost no chance in the next election. So they do it at any price. What should be done if the level of development (this is the next problem, a technological one), the level of productive power, the level of technological development and technological structure in today’s world does not allow us to quickly ensure fast-growing and increasing drive for consumption? At some stage, this was ensured through technological development, but it is no longer the case. So during such periods, I always recall Kondratyev, our scientist who spoke about long waves of crisis. It seems this long wave has come. We need a change in technological structure so as to ensure a growing demand for consumption. And this change in technological structure has not yet occurred. The political system is such that it promises everything, but is not able to deliver. Citizens are used to living at a certain level, and there is nothing that could convince people in Spain, for example, that they should live the same way as people in rural China. China is ensuring its growth rates by using technology and a constant flow of millions of workers to large cities. That opportunity does not exist in Europe. So what’s the source of growth then? Debt, debt, debt. They have turned on the monetary printing press. And these are the results of the problems that lie deeper. That is what caused the debt crisis. I think that Germany’s leaders are taking a very pragmatic position that the systemic problems which led to this state must first be eliminated, and then additional resources should be injected. If the opposite is done then the additional resources will simply be dissolved, they will only provide a temporary ‘kick in the butt’. But there will not be sufficient acceleration in order to overcome the entire distance that would allow Europe to get out of crisis. Indeed, I think that this is pretty evident. Yes, of course, the position must be flexible. Naturally, certain monetary measures – additional issues, attempts to artificially heat up the economy – have a short-term effect, but you know, that’s like a pill that simply reduces a fever but does not cure the disease itself. So I think that systemic measures are necessary. In my view, those are exactly the kind of measures that EU leaders are inclined to use. And in any case, everyone within the EU leadership – and the people in all the EU nations in general are very competent and well-versed in economic matters – they all understand what needs to be done. The question concerns the political frameworks in which they find themselves, and whether these frameworks give them the opportunity to work in the right direction or hold them back. As for what our colleagues will ultimately do, that is, first and foremost, a European choice. As for the idea of Russia joining the EU, we all understand perfectly well that this is not realistic either from the point of view of our size or our economic organisation. But I think we should most certainly look for means of rapprochement so as to make use of the synergy to be gained from combining the efforts of Russia and its European partners. Someone like you is already very much aware of the fact that Russia has a highly educated population and a strong base in the fundamental sciences. We have abundant mineral resources and well-prepared human resources capable of learning new skills quickly. Look at the way our automotive industry is developing. Companies have opened up almost overnight and human resources training is rapid and effective. Everyone I speak with from among the company directors, the heads of German companies such as Volkswagen and others, the Japanese, they all say that they have absolutely no trouble finding local staff and training them very quickly. This is one of Russia’s advantages. If we could combine the European Union’s technological capabilities with Russia’s huge territory and the opportunities our country offers, the resulting synergy would be tremendous and would make us all more competitive. Sadly, however, we are moving only very slowly in this direction. Coming back to an issue I already spoke about before, Russia proposed joint work on a satellite navigation system a few years ago. Our colleagues expressed interest in the idea but in the end decided not to go ahead. What is the result? Russia has a fully completed satellite cluster of 28 satellites in operation now, while the Europeans have only launched 5 satellites, as far as I know. But if they had used the opportunities we offered for space launches and our development of the GLONASS system, both GLONASS and Europe’s Galileo system would be working effectively today and would be a real competition for GPS. Would this be a good or a bad thing? It would be a good thing of course, not because it would let us bite off a piece from someone else’s pie, but because it would develop this sector of the global economy in general. Greater competition would make the sector more effective and give it more weight. This is just one example.  We have made no progress towards introducing visa-free travel. Really, this is just laughable. Europe has visa-free travel with some Latin American countries. Is the crime situation there really any better than in Russia? Of course not. This is all quite absurd, you understand. I am at a loss really to understand our colleagues’ motivations here. These are things that are holding back rapprochement between Russia and the EU, and this is not a good situation. Coming now to the Common Economic Space, in large part, we took the integration achievements in Europe as our reference model here. We do have a few advantages of our own though, because, as many of you no doubt realise, start discussing anything in the EU and the 27 countries with their 27 languages all make for such a bureaucratic nightmare that you feel like you’re never going to make it alive to actually getting to the point of what the various speakers are saying. No one has the strength to sit through it all. But we have the Russian language that unites us as a natural common language of interstate communication, and this is a huge advantage.  Furthermore, the infrastructure system – railways, energy sector infrastructure, aviation links – though we consider it still in need of further development, lays a solid base on which to build integration. This was our common infrastructure during the Soviet period. The countries that made up the Soviet Union then inherited its various parts, but we can use it in our common interests. There are railways for example that first cross Russian territory, then enter Kazakhstani territory, then come back onto Russian territory. Indeed, the situation is such that the heavens themselves incite us to integrate, and so this is what we are doing. We decided that each country would use its national currency. On the one hand, this is bad because it does not let the ruble strengthen its position, but at the same time it is good, because each country can implement its own economic policy. When it comes to this area we need to take the European Union’s failures into account. We need to look at the debt situation there, the macroeconomic situation, the situation with the other main economic development factors, and the effect the common currency has had in the EU. It seems to me that in terms of their economic development level, not all of the participating countries have always measured up to the demands of the common currency system. Argentina at one time decided to peg its national currency tightly to the dollar, and they then had great difficulty coping with problems in their main economic sectors. They were practically unable to carry out any kind of devaluation. If Greece had still used the drachma they would have been able to devalue the currency in time and might have avoided such serious problems. This would have been a good signal that macroeconomic corrections needed to be made. But they ended up with no option other than getting themselves into debt. And so, before we ever contemplate introducing a common currency between Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus, we would first need to harmonise our macroeconomic and financial policy.  We would need to draw up common and strictly regulated policy with regard to the main economic development factors and only then start looking at the possibilities for introducing a common currency. As it happens, we already use the ruble in a fairly large share of our non-cash settlements with Belarus. We would need to summarise and analyse all of this, look at how our economies are developing, and not just sign agreements, but put in place mechanisms for supervising common economic policy. Only then could we move on to a deeper stage of integration.  I think that Europe, acting out of political considerations, got ahead of itself. It tried to apply the common rules that could work in developed market economies to countries that in terms of their economic development level were not yet ready for this. It is not that the idea itself is wrong, but simply that perhaps it should have been carried out under different conditions.  Finding the solution to this situation however, as I said, is a matter for our partners. We can but sincerely wish them success and say that we hope they will find the best solution because the EU, after all, is Russia’s biggest trade and economic partner. Alexander Rahr: Thank you. That was a question from a ‘new’ European. Now let’s have a question from an ‘old’ European – John Peet from The Economist. European Editor of the Economist (Britain) John Peet (retranslated): Mr President, I will put my question in English, if you don’t mind. Svetlana Mironyuk and Mr Rahr said already that we are talking about economic development scenarios in Russia. The question is one of industrial transition of a kind that would reduce dependence on energy resources. Russia would probably like to expand development of its processing and manufacturing industries. Some have expressed doubts about the need for and chances of success of such a policy, but Russia does have quite strong experience in these sectors, though it would have to compete with China in areas such as raising the quality of its goods. But perhaps, rather than manufacturing something, Russia could focus on developing agriculture, forestry, the pulp and paper industry, develop Siberia, and develop provision of services, because services after all are a fundamental part of any modern economy. Russia could attract small businesses, and could improve its business climate by reducing corruption and bureaucracy and lowering taxes. Do you think that advocates of these views are right, or do you think that Russia should concentrate on developing its manufacturing and processing sectors? Vladimir Putin: Russia should concentrate not on manufacturing and processing, but on economic sectors with a future, sectors based on new technology and with prospects for growth in this twenty-first century. One of our scholars, Academician Tamm, said that the twenty-first century would be the ‘century of biology,’ just as the twentieth century was the ‘century of physics’. He was absolutely right, because we see now how nanotechnology and biotechnology have come to the forefront and are being used ever more widely. It is hard to even imagine all the potential results of using new technology.  We will therefore develop all of the different sectors, agriculture too. Russia, after all, has a lot of black earth and land that is good for agriculture, and we will naturally try to make use of this competitive advantage. We need to use our territorial advantages to develop services above all in transport, trans-Siberian flights and flights between the USA and Asia, and between Europe and Asia, for example. These are the most economically effective routes. The Northern Sea Route, if properly developed, would also be the most effective route for transporting goods between Europe and Asia and would work out a lot cheaper than going via the Suez Canal. But we need to stay focused on the future. We have the possibilities for this. As you know, we set up a special nanotechnology centre a few years ago and it is developing well in general. I already mentioned our targeted programmes for developing medicine and medical technology. I think these are areas with a future, and it is on sectors such as these that we should concentrate our attention. But we should do this not so much by relying on state resources as on putting in place the conditions that will open up these sectors to private capital and private business. This is not an easy undertaking, and I cannot say yet that we have already managed to put these conditions in place, but this is our goal. Alexander Rahr: Thank you. I will now give the floor to our Chinese colleague, another of the Valdai Club’s regular participants, Mr Feng, a well-known historian and political analyst from Shanghai. DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF ADVANCED INTERNATIONAL AND AREA STUDIES, EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIVERSITY, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRE FOR RUSSIAN STUDIES FENG SHAOLEI: Mr President, It is a great pleasure to meet with you again. You have assessed highly the development of economic ties between Russia and Asia. This is very important. But as you know, great change is underway in Asia too. The geopolitical situation has become a lot tenser. The Asian economies continue to grow, but growth rates have slowed down somewhat. Will you continue to advocate developing ties with Asia, or will you make some adjustments to the concept for developing the Far East and Siberia? I think this is an important issue, though we realise that it is not a simple matter. Time will be needed. I would like to know, now that you have taken this big initiative, what specific progress has been achieved so far, and what are the prospects ahead and the opportunities for international cooperation? Vladimir Putin: You said just now that growth rates in Asia are slowing. This is indeed the case and we see it and are aware of the fact. I imagine you were thinking primarily of the slowdown in growth in China, your country. But let me say that I do not think this is such a worrying signal. Let me explain why I say this. Of course we would like China, the world’s second biggest economy, to maintain high growth because China is Russia’s biggest trading partner today with bilateral trade of $83.5 billion. This is followed by Germany, with bilateral trade of $72 billion. Naturally, we would like to sell more to China and buy more from China, but there is one circumstance I want to point out. I think that Chinese specialists are taking the right step by restraining the growth rate a little, because otherwise there is the risk of producing a bubble. You can run into problems if you artificially overheat the economy, and so I think China is doing the right thing by slowing the pace a little. That is my first point. Second, we know that China is taking measures, including administrative measures, to rein in lending to the economy, and I think this is also absolutely correct because these are things that need to be kept under control.  Third, China trades with the entire world, with the USA, with Europe. If economies face problems elsewhere in the world this automatically has an impact on the Chinese economy too. Fortunately, I think nothing disastrous has happened so far and the situation was quite foreseeable, but it will not stop Russia from developing its relations with China over the medium-term and strategic perspective. Indeed, we have already agreed on the objective of bringing our bilateral trade up to $100 billion. I think we will reach this goal. We can do this by increasing our trade operations and increasing our energy exports to China. I think we will reach agreements not only on sales of oil but also on gas exports. Exports of Chinese goods, including mass consumer goods, to the Russian market will also boost our trade. Let’s not forget that Russia is now a full-fledged member of the World Trade Organisation, as is China.  We will continue this policy of increasing trade through big projects too, among which is our cooperation in peaceful nuclear energy. The Tianwang nuclear power plant is already in operation, the first unit has come on line, and our Chinese colleagues are happy with the facility, which was built using the latest technology. We will continue this cooperation and have already agreed on this with our Chinese friends. Chinese companies and specialists will perform a substantial share of the contracts under these projects. Chinese specialists are already carrying out 25–30 percent of the total share of work. We will continue our cooperation with our Chinese partners in aviation and rocket technology. These and other sectors all offer opportunities that make me optimistic that our trade and economic ties will continue their steady development. In this respect, I hope that following on from our first steps in using the ruble-yuan pair in settlements we will move on to the next step and start using our national currencies as the real basis for servicing our bilateral trade. This is not as easy as it looks at first glance. We have already taken the first steps, however, and will continue to move in this direction, all the more so as Chinese specialists are very interested in the idea too and welcome the use of our national currencies in mutual settlements. As you know, the ruble is now a fully convertible currency and we set no limits or timeframes on outflow of capital, nor do we burden our partners with additional reserves when taking capital out of the country or converting it into dollars or euros. The yuan is not yet a fully convertible currency, but this is all a matter of time. I think we will come up with the cooperation mechanisms that will enable us to develop our financial sector relations.  Svetlana Mironyuk: Thank you very much, Alexander. We have finished work on the first conceptual block and are moving on to the second, which is devoted to economic development scenarios in Russia that our colleagues discussed at the sessions in St Petersburg. I pass the floor to Piotr Dutkiewicz. Please, Piotr, go ahead. Director of the Centre For Governance and Public Policy At Carleton University (CANADA) PIOTR DUTKIEWICZ: Thank you very much. Mr President, over the last several days, the Valdai Club has been discussing four scenarios for Russia’s economic development. And the scenarios were built on a combination of two types of factors. One group of factors involved the nation’s domestic resources, which we felt were very good. Russia has great resources – both human and natural. But it was noted that they are not fully utilised. The second group of factors involved the rules and conditions that allow these resources to be used effectively for the nation, such as institutions, the law, political decisions and so on. These scenarios have been split into two groups so that one group includes all the growth opportunities that are built on mobilising domestic resources, mainly by increasing governance efficiency, helping small and medium-sized businesses, and involving the creative class. And the second group discussed possible options for growth on the basis of an increased dependence on external factors such as capital. For example, whether capital flows in or not, whether oil prices remain stable, or they rise or fall, etc. And of course, these are external factors that, on the one hand, can promote the nation’s development, but on the other hand, they can affect its economic security. Based on that discussion, the following conclusion can be drawn. Overall, the nation’s macroeconomic situation, as our experts say, looks significantly better than many imagine. We began with a relatively negative scenario, but it turned out that it wouldn’t be that bad. And by 2030, Russia can certainly reach Switzerland’s current level. This version of the future greatly depends on how well the nation’s domestic resources are utilised. There are three issues involved. First is the quality of governance at all levels – at the top, beginning with you, and all the way down to local self-governments. Vladimir Putin: Well, it’s all just fine on my end. Piotr Dutkiewicz: There will be questions on this matter as well. Vladimir Putin: Oh, here we go. Piotr Dutkiewicz: The second is building a true partnership with creative class. Engaging local businesses, the intelligentsia and medium-sized businesses to a much greater degree than right now. And the third is ensuring detailed and stable conditions for domestic and foreign capital. But it’s one thing to ponder this at the expert level, as we have been doing with our colleagues, and it’s entirely different to make decisions that affect the quality of life for tens of millions of Russians. Thus, I would like to ask you: what will you consider to be negative and what will you consider to be a good scenario for Russia’s economic development? Or to put it another way, in what areas would you give yourself a grade of A or B+? And in what areas would you give the Government a grade of B or D? And what aspects of your own society, Russian citizens, would receive a C or an A grade? Vladimir Putin: You know, it’s somewhat hard for me to get my bearings and focus on an answer, it’s very multidimensional. Piotr Dutkiewicz: The report was quite complicated, sorry; it was hard to predict. Vladimir Putin: First of all, it is fairly complicated to grade the Government, and even more so the entire society. But I can tell you that we will employ external factors and domestic factors – we should and will use everything that will promote the development of our economy. If the domestic factors are favourable, they should be taken advantage of; it would be absurd not to. If the situation is good, why would we work against it? But we must keep in mind that the situation will not always be as favourable and we’ve had such examples in the recent past. So I absolutely agree with you, Piotr, indeed, you yourself partially answered this in asking the question. We need to employ the domestic factors and rely on domestic demand, but in order for this domestic demand to develop, we need to make quite a bit of effort, first and foremost, to improve business conditions. I don’t know how fair it was when the World Bank put Russia in 120th place in terms of conditions for running business, but I already spoke about this publicly, and I imagine some of you heard me: our goal is to become among the top 20 or 30 nations that are considered best for running a business. But I should tell you that just recently, the World Bank conducted a study and Russia has already risen to 112th place. And if we consider tax administration, for example, it’s even higher. It turns out that we are even ahead of the United States of America in terms of our tax administration. In other words, the objectives we are setting for ourselves are not just possible to fulfil, they are actually being implemented. We are moving forward. We have formed a whole plan in this area, to improve business. And we were not doing this alone, behind the scenes, in our offices; we were working together with members of the main business associations. Actually, they drew up our system of values and suggested a set of measures to reach the goals we are setting for ourselves. We now have this plan, and it is being consistently implemented through the enactment of laws and bylaws. We have outlined a whole list of these concrete steps. We have published them all so you can easily browse them. I feel that this should lead to a significant increase in labour productivity – about twofold. This is a very difficult challenge. But if we do not set ambitious goals for ourselves, we will never achieve them. And in this regard, and I have said this before as well, we need to think about increasing the number of high-efficiency and high-tech jobs. We feel that we can increase the number of high-tech jobs by 25 million. (Actually, it’s not just the Government or myself who think so, the businesses also feel this way, and these figures were initially proposed by members of business associations.) This does not mean creating new jobs, but rather, retraining existing employees for new working conditions and standards. Perhaps this figure might seem a bit exaggerated, but I think we must strive toward it. And if the figure ends up being 20 million, I assure you that this would also be a significant change for Russia’s entire economy. As far as the “creative class” you spoke about is concerned, naturally, it is impossible to do anything without it. It is impossible to do anything without highly trained professionals in general. This is true for both highly trained engineering professionals as well as, incidentally, people who are simply working on modern assembly lines. Unfortunately, we do not have many such modern educational institutions, but they are emerging. I was happy to see how, for example, in St Petersburg, in a vocational school, they are training modern workers using the most advanced equipment, which, by the way, they bought in Germany and Switzerland. These are good professionals – absolutely world-class. So our goal is to diversify, and I tried to give a broad overview of the ways for diversification. I repeat, one of the key areas is improving business conditions. On this basis, on this foundation, we hope to attract capital: both our own domestic capital, even if it involves the repatriation of our domestic capital from abroad, and purely foreign capital. We created a Direct Investment Fund very recently. We agreed to capitalise it every year over the course of the next several years, and next year, we plan to inject add another 60 billion rubles in capital. The Fund has established direct contacts with all of the world’s major investment platforms and has just about begun its work. I think that this might also bring some very good momentum to the development, first and foremost, in high-tech areas of the economy.\", 'kremlin_id': 16717, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting with Valdai International Discussion Club participants', 'teaser': 'During his meeting with members of the Valdai International Discussion Club, Vladimir Putin talked about the current state of the Russian economy and scenarios for Russia’s economic development.', 'tags': ['Economy and finance', 'Foreign policy'], 'transcript_filtered': \"Good afternoon, friends, ladies and gentlemen, You have already had the opportunity to speak with my colleagues, as in the previous years, and I think they have told you practically everything, so I don’t know what we're going to talk about. I suggest we just enjoy our dinner, we are going to have some wonderful wine and good food. But if some questions arise that still remain unclear, I will do my best to answer them. I say “do my best” because you have met with ministers and representatives of major companies. Each of them is an expert in his or her field, whereas I focus on the bigger picture, if you like. But, I repeat, if something remains unclear, I will try to satisfy your curiosity as far as I can. In any case, I would like to say at the beginning of our conversation that we highly value (and I personally truly appreciate) our regular annual meetings. I am very pleased that the international expert community still retains a keen interest in Russia, and I am glad that such esteemed experts on our country as those represented here can state Russia’s objective position in a timely manner, and interpret it with full knowledge of what is really happening in the Russian Federation. There are few people, other than Russians themselves, who understand it. Therefore, I am at your disposal. I am very glad to see you. Welcome, and enjoy your meal. In Russia no one is ever to blame. Thank you. If we speak at length on the subject raised by Mr Rahr, we won’t be able to talk about anything else. You can start and finish with it. So I’ll try to be brief. First of all, about how we are lucky or unlucky because of our hydrocarbons and other mineral resources. Some believe that the Soviet Union’s economic development began to stall when it started to produce vast quantities of oil. When there was a lot of oil, it became cheap while oil and gas revenues grew, and the Soviet economy lost the impetus for development. It was all there anyway, these riches fell down from the sky or rather came from underground. This is partly true. However, it is true only in part because the main problem was the non-market nature of the Soviet economy, the lack of competition and so on. A large amount of cheap mineral resources only aggravated the situation. As for modern Russia, it is a challenge we face as well. The challenge is the temptation of cheap mineral resources, which we have in abundance. This is true. But that is why we are making efforts to diversify the Russian economy. We talk a lot about it and I’m sure you discussed it with my colleagues, the ministers, with whom you met. Do these efforts bring about any positive changes? I think they do. Of course, 50 percent of our budget revenue comes from oil and gas sales. But if we take it as a percentage of our overall GDP, the oil-and-gas sector revenue is declining. And we plan for this revenue to drop even further against the GDP total. We believe that this extensive economic development model, which is based on mineral resources, has largely worked itself out. But naturally, if prices remain high enough, it would make no sense for us to sell our raw materials below world prices. That would simply be absurd. And if we sell them based on the higher global prices, the federal budget will get higher revenues from those resources accordingly. This is obvious. But given that we need to be thrifty and stimulate the economy as well as various sectors toward diversification, what are we doing? First of all, we are implementing stimulating measures. For example, we are introducing tax incentives for high-tech companies. And overall, they generally work quite efficiently. As you know, the tax component for workers and their salaries is very important for this sector of the economy, and the tax rate for small innovative enterprises in this sector is much lower than in other sectors of the economy. This is just one of the examples, one of the measures. At the same time, we are reducing budgetary expenditures that are financed out of oil-and-gas sector revenue. We implemented this for the first time, as we discussed last year, and beginning next year, we will be implementing the so-called budget rule, which we will use to calculate the average oil price for the past few years and, based on that price, plan our budget revenues and expenditures. Currently, as you know, the average price of our Urals blend is $111 per barrel. We take the next year’s oil price at around $104 per barrel, but applying the budget rule, we will only take into account that part of budget revenue that corresponds to the oil price of $91 per barrel. The planned budget expenditures would not result in a deficit if the oil price is $104 per barrel, so we are planning on having a slight deficit and feel it is justified. And most importantly, we have sources of financing if that deficit does occur. I will point out that last year and this year, we also planned on having a slight deficit. Last year, we ended up with a surplus of 0.8 percent, and this year, we have also had a surplus for the January-August period, and are likely to have a surplus at the end of the year as well. Nevertheless, we will calculate our expenditures based on oil price of $91 per barrel in 2013, $92 per barrel in 2014 and $93 per barrel in 2015. Overall, we will be very careful, and when we reduce our revenue and, accordingly, our expenditures, this spurs all the other sectors to be much more efficient. Moreover, we have adopted a whole programme on energy efficiency and the development of nanotechnology. We are taking separate stimulating measures to develop the aviation sector, the aerospace sector, and biomedicine. We have a separate programme with an allotment of, I’m not sure but I believe 120 billion rubles, to develop medical equipment and the pharmaceutical industry. We are taking a broad approach, creating infrastructural incentives in the form of tax breaks and giving additional resources for the development of promising high-tech sectors. We expect that we will be able to diversify the nation’s economy. Rosneft. It is true that the Cabinet and I had mixed feelings when this project came up, specifically Rosneft’s purchase of BP’s interest. Indeed, the project began from that point, rather than the purchase of interest in TNK, i.e. the Russian stake. What was the cause of these mixed feelings? I will answer this very honestly. First, what did we consider as the downsides? The fact that a company with mainly state participation was increasing its presence on the market through a foreign partner. There was concern that the second part, i.e. the Russian part of TNK, could also be absorbed by Rosneft, a state company. And overall, that does not correspond to our trend of curbing government sector growth. But there was also another component (and the overwhelming majority of the experts present here know this): the fact that there was absolutely no unity between TNK-BP members; instead, there was a constant conflict lasting many years that occasionally came to blows. And I once warned that this was not a functional structure, when former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair and I attended the signing of the documents establishing this joint company (they did it on a “fifty-fifty” basis). Even then, I stated that the Russian Government and I would not object if our foreign partner were to hold controlling stakes. Just as we would be happy if the Russian side received the controlling stakes. There must be somebody to manage the company. They told me, “No, we will come to an agreement, we will settle this all amongst ourselves.” Well, they didn’t come to an agreement! They didn’t settle it! And all of their work was advancing from conflict to conflict. The foreign partner – the BP company – has turned to us many times for help. We tried not to get involved in their corporate disputes, but when BP came to the Cabinet, the BP executives came to me and said that they would like to cooperate with Rosneft (and this is the second part I wanted to talk about), we could not say “no” to them because otherwise, it would be perceived as if we were putting them in the same category as TNK, with which they have a constant conflict. We had a difficult choice to make. But ultimately, we nevertheless agreed with Rosneft and BP’s suggestion, their joint suggestion that they could work together. As for the second part, the possible sale of the second part of TNK to Rosneft, this would be an initiative that should come from TNK shareholders themselves; they have expressed their desire to sell their part as well. And the third component is that this is not just a purchase and sale deal, but also an exchange of shares, including both shares that belonged to Rosneft itself as well as, I believe, a 5.7 percent stake in Rosneft held by the state. And that is basically a part of our strategic plans; this is pretty much a privatisation, allowing a private foreign company into a Russian state company. At the same time, they, our partners from the UK, are taking on a fairly big stake, I can’t recall right now the exact figure, but I think this information is freely available. In any case, it gives them the opportunity to have a representative on the board of directors, which is a separate issue. At any rate, I am assuming that if there is a representative from a major shareholder on the board of directors, this will ensure additional transparency in activities of our biggest oil company, Rosneft, which incidentally is the world’s biggest crude oil producer. In terms of overall production volumes, including oil products, ExxonMobil is much bigger, but when it comes to crude oil production, Rosneft has taken first place worldwide. First, as far as the crisis in Europe is concerned, this is ultimately not our problem. I feel that it wouldn’t even be entirely right for me to comment on all of this, because I have a great deal of respect for my European colleagues. They are facing extremely difficult economic, social and political challenges, and I do not really want to throw in my own comments which, one way or another, might put some sort of pressure on them. I can only repeat what I have said at international meetings, and our position is publicly known, so I will not go into details. I will say the following. Naturally, what we are seeing now in Europe is a systemic crisis, and it is not caused by debt alone. I think the problem goes far deeper. It is partially political in nature, partially technological, and partially pertains to problems with the integration process itself. As for its political nature, I think it’s on the surface. To paraphrase Churchill, the current system of power is a terrible system, but it’s the best we’ve got. Where does it lead to in practice? We all understand that. A party striving for power, promising everything unsparingly. That is the nature of today’s civilised world. They keep making promises, and then try to fulfil some of them. If they don’t, that’s it; they stand almost no chance in the next election. So they do it at any price. What should be done if the level of development (this is the next problem, a technological one), the level of productive power, the level of technological development and technological structure in today’s world does not allow us to quickly ensure fast-growing and increasing drive for consumption? At some stage, this was ensured through technological development, but it is no longer the case. So during such periods, I always recall Kondratyev, our scientist who spoke about long waves of crisis. It seems this long wave has come. We need a change in technological structure so as to ensure a growing demand for consumption. And this change in technological structure has not yet occurred. The political system is such that it promises everything, but is not able to deliver. Citizens are used to living at a certain level, and there is nothing that could convince people in Spain, for example, that they should live the same way as people in rural China. China is ensuring its growth rates by using technology and a constant flow of millions of workers to large cities. That opportunity does not exist in Europe. So what’s the source of growth then? Debt, debt, debt. They have turned on the monetary printing press. And these are the results of the problems that lie deeper. That is what caused the debt crisis. I think that Germany’s leaders are taking a very pragmatic position that the systemic problems which led to this state must first be eliminated, and then additional resources should be injected. If the opposite is done then the additional resources will simply be dissolved, they will only provide a temporary ‘kick in the butt’. But there will not be sufficient acceleration in order to overcome the entire distance that would allow Europe to get out of crisis. Indeed, I think that this is pretty evident. Yes, of course, the position must be flexible. Naturally, certain monetary measures – additional issues, attempts to artificially heat up the economy – have a short-term effect, but you know, that’s like a pill that simply reduces a fever but does not cure the disease itself. So I think that systemic measures are necessary. In my view, those are exactly the kind of measures that EU leaders are inclined to use. And in any case, everyone within the EU leadership – and the people in all the EU nations in general are very competent and well-versed in economic matters – they all understand what needs to be done. The question concerns the political frameworks in which they find themselves, and whether these frameworks give them the opportunity to work in the right direction or hold them back. As for what our colleagues will ultimately do, that is, first and foremost, a European choice. As for the idea of Russia joining the EU, we all understand perfectly well that this is not realistic either from the point of view of our size or our economic organisation. But I think we should most certainly look for means of rapprochement so as to make use of the synergy to be gained from combining the efforts of Russia and its European partners. Someone like you is already very much aware of the fact that Russia has a highly educated population and a strong base in the fundamental sciences. We have abundant mineral resources and well-prepared human resources capable of learning new skills quickly. Look at the way our automotive industry is developing. Companies have opened up almost overnight and human resources training is rapid and effective. Everyone I speak with from among the company directors, the heads of German companies such as Volkswagen and others, the Japanese, they all say that they have absolutely no trouble finding local staff and training them very quickly. This is one of Russia’s advantages. If we could combine the European Union’s technological capabilities with Russia’s huge territory and the opportunities our country offers, the resulting synergy would be tremendous and would make us all more competitive. Sadly, however, we are moving only very slowly in this direction. Coming back to an issue I already spoke about before, Russia proposed joint work on a satellite navigation system a few years ago. Our colleagues expressed interest in the idea but in the end decided not to go ahead. What is the result? Russia has a fully completed satellite cluster of 28 satellites in operation now, while the Europeans have only launched 5 satellites, as far as I know. But if they had used the opportunities we offered for space launches and our development of the GLONASS system, both GLONASS and Europe’s Galileo system would be working effectively today and would be a real competition for GPS. Would this be a good or a bad thing? It would be a good thing of course, not because it would let us bite off a piece from someone else’s pie, but because it would develop this sector of the global economy in general. Greater competition would make the sector more effective and give it more weight. This is just one example.  We have made no progress towards introducing visa-free travel. Really, this is just laughable. Europe has visa-free travel with some Latin American countries. Is the crime situation there really any better than in Russia? Of course not. This is all quite absurd, you understand. I am at a loss really to understand our colleagues’ motivations here. These are things that are holding back rapprochement between Russia and the EU, and this is not a good situation. Coming now to the Common Economic Space, in large part, we took the integration achievements in Europe as our reference model here. We do have a few advantages of our own though, because, as many of you no doubt realise, start discussing anything in the EU and the 27 countries with their 27 languages all make for such a bureaucratic nightmare that you feel like you’re never going to make it alive to actually getting to the point of what the various speakers are saying. No one has the strength to sit through it all. But we have the Russian language that unites us as a natural common language of interstate communication, and this is a huge advantage.  Furthermore, the infrastructure system – railways, energy sector infrastructure, aviation links – though we consider it still in need of further development, lays a solid base on which to build integration. This was our common infrastructure during the Soviet period. The countries that made up the Soviet Union then inherited its various parts, but we can use it in our common interests. There are railways for example that first cross Russian territory, then enter Kazakhstani territory, then come back onto Russian territory. Indeed, the situation is such that the heavens themselves incite us to integrate, and so this is what we are doing. We decided that each country would use its national currency. On the one hand, this is bad because it does not let the ruble strengthen its position, but at the same time it is good, because each country can implement its own economic policy. When it comes to this area we need to take the European Union’s failures into account. We need to look at the debt situation there, the macroeconomic situation, the situation with the other main economic development factors, and the effect the common currency has had in the EU. It seems to me that in terms of their economic development level, not all of the participating countries have always measured up to the demands of the common currency system. Argentina at one time decided to peg its national currency tightly to the dollar, and they then had great difficulty coping with problems in their main economic sectors. They were practically unable to carry out any kind of devaluation. If Greece had still used the drachma they would have been able to devalue the currency in time and might have avoided such serious problems. This would have been a good signal that macroeconomic corrections needed to be made. But they ended up with no option other than getting themselves into debt. And so, before we ever contemplate introducing a common currency between Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus, we would first need to harmonise our macroeconomic and financial policy.  We would need to draw up common and strictly regulated policy with regard to the main economic development factors and only then start looking at the possibilities for introducing a common currency. As it happens, we already use the ruble in a fairly large share of our non-cash settlements with Belarus. We would need to summarise and analyse all of this, look at how our economies are developing, and not just sign agreements, but put in place mechanisms for supervising common economic policy. Only then could we move on to a deeper stage of integration.  I think that Europe, acting out of political considerations, got ahead of itself. It tried to apply the common rules that could work in developed market economies to countries that in terms of their economic development level were not yet ready for this. It is not that the idea itself is wrong, but simply that perhaps it should have been carried out under different conditions.  Finding the solution to this situation however, as I said, is a matter for our partners. We can but sincerely wish them success and say that we hope they will find the best solution because the EU, after all, is Russia’s biggest trade and economic partner. Russia should concentrate not on manufacturing and processing, but on economic sectors with a future, sectors based on new technology and with prospects for growth in this twenty-first century. One of our scholars, Academician Tamm, said that the twenty-first century would be the ‘century of biology,’ just as the twentieth century was the ‘century of physics’. He was absolutely right, because we see now how nanotechnology and biotechnology have come to the forefront and are being used ever more widely. It is hard to even imagine all the potential results of using new technology. We will therefore develop all of the different sectors, agriculture too. Russia, after all, has a lot of black earth and land that is good for agriculture, and we will naturally try to make use of this competitive advantage. We need to use our territorial advantages to develop services above all in transport, trans-Siberian flights and flights between the USA and Asia, and between Europe and Asia, for example. These are the most economically effective routes. The Northern Sea Route, if properly developed, would also be the most effective route for transporting goods between Europe and Asia and would work out a lot cheaper than going via the Suez Canal. But we need to stay focused on the future. We have the possibilities for this. As you know, we set up a special nanotechnology centre a few years ago and it is developing well in general. I already mentioned our targeted programmes for developing medicine and medical technology. I think these are areas with a future, and it is on sectors such as these that we should concentrate our attention. But we should do this not so much by relying on state resources as on putting in place the conditions that will open up these sectors to private capital and private business. This is not an easy undertaking, and I cannot say yet that we have already managed to put these conditions in place, but this is our goal. You said just now that growth rates in Asia are slowing. This is indeed the case and we see it and are aware of the fact. I imagine you were thinking primarily of the slowdown in growth in China, your country. But let me say that I do not think this is such a worrying signal. Let me explain why I say this. Of course we would like China, the world’s second biggest economy, to maintain high growth because China is Russia’s biggest trading partner today with bilateral trade of $83.5 billion. This is followed by Germany, with bilateral trade of $72 billion. Naturally, we would like to sell more to China and buy more from China, but there is one circumstance I want to point out. I think that Chinese specialists are taking the right step by restraining the growth rate a little, because otherwise there is the risk of producing a bubble. You can run into problems if you artificially overheat the economy, and so I think China is doing the right thing by slowing the pace a little. That is my first point. Second, we know that China is taking measures, including administrative measures, to rein in lending to the economy, and I think this is also absolutely correct because these are things that need to be kept under control.  Third, China trades with the entire world, with the USA, with Europe. If economies face problems elsewhere in the world this automatically has an impact on the Chinese economy too. Fortunately, I think nothing disastrous has happened so far and the situation was quite foreseeable, but it will not stop Russia from developing its relations with China over the medium-term and strategic perspective. Indeed, we have already agreed on the objective of bringing our bilateral trade up to $100 billion. I think we will reach this goal. We can do this by increasing our trade operations and increasing our energy exports to China. I think we will reach agreements not only on sales of oil but also on gas exports. Exports of Chinese goods, including mass consumer goods, to the Russian market will also boost our trade. Let’s not forget that Russia is now a full-fledged member of the World Trade Organisation, as is China.  We will continue this policy of increasing trade through big projects too, among which is our cooperation in peaceful nuclear energy. The Tianwang nuclear power plant is already in operation, the first unit has come on line, and our Chinese colleagues are happy with the facility, which was built using the latest technology. We will continue this cooperation and have already agreed on this with our Chinese friends. Chinese companies and specialists will perform a substantial share of the contracts under these projects. Chinese specialists are already carrying out 25–30 percent of the total share of work. We will continue our cooperation with our Chinese partners in aviation and rocket technology. These and other sectors all offer opportunities that make me optimistic that our trade and economic ties will continue their steady development. In this respect, I hope that following on from our first steps in using the ruble-yuan pair in settlements we will move on to the next step and start using our national currencies as the real basis for servicing our bilateral trade. This is not as easy as it looks at first glance. We have already taken the first steps, however, and will continue to move in this direction, all the more so as Chinese specialists are very interested in the idea too and welcome the use of our national currencies in mutual settlements. As you know, the ruble is now a fully convertible currency and we set no limits or timeframes on outflow of capital, nor do we burden our partners with additional reserves when taking capital out of the country or converting it into dollars or euros. The yuan is not yet a fully convertible currency, but this is all a matter of time. I think we will come up with the cooperation mechanisms that will enable us to develop our financial sector relations.  Well, it’s all just fine on my end. Oh, here we go. You know, it’s somewhat hard for me to get my bearings and focus on an answer, it’s very multidimensional. First of all, it is fairly complicated to grade the Government, and even more so the entire society. But I can tell you that we will employ external factors and domestic factors – we should and will use everything that will promote the development of our economy. If the domestic factors are favourable, they should be taken advantage of; it would be absurd not to. If the situation is good, why would we work against it? But we must keep in mind that the situation will not always be as favourable and we’ve had such examples in the recent past. So I absolutely agree with you, Piotr, indeed, you yourself partially answered this in asking the question. We need to employ the domestic factors and rely on domestic demand, but in order for this domestic demand to develop, we need to make quite a bit of effort, first and foremost, to improve business conditions. I don’t know how fair it was when the World Bank put Russia in 120th place in terms of conditions for running business, but I already spoke about this publicly, and I imagine some of you heard me: our goal is to become among the top 20 or 30 nations that are considered best for running a business. But I should tell you that just recently, the World Bank conducted a study and Russia has already risen to 112th place. And if we consider tax administration, for example, it’s even higher. It turns out that we are even ahead of the United States of America in terms of our tax administration. In other words, the objectives we are setting for ourselves are not just possible to fulfil, they are actually being implemented. We are moving forward. We have formed a whole plan in this area, to improve business. And we were not doing this alone, behind the scenes, in our offices; we were working together with members of the main business associations. Actually, they drew up our system of values and suggested a set of measures to reach the goals we are setting for ourselves. We now have this plan, and it is being consistently implemented through the enactment of laws and bylaws. We have outlined a whole list of these concrete steps. We have published them all so you can easily browse them. I feel that this should lead to a significant increase in labour productivity – about twofold. This is a very difficult challenge. But if we do not set ambitious goals for ourselves, we will never achieve them. And in this regard, and I have said this before as well, we need to think about increasing the number of high-efficiency and high-tech jobs. We feel that we can increase the number of high-tech jobs by 25 million. (Actually, it’s not just the Government or myself who think so, the businesses also feel this way, and these figures were initially proposed by members of business associations.) This does not mean creating new jobs, but rather, retraining existing employees for new working conditions and standards. Perhaps this figure might seem a bit exaggerated, but I think we must strive toward it. And if the figure ends up being 20 million, I assure you that this would also be a significant change for Russia’s entire economy. As far as the “creative class” you spoke about is concerned, naturally, it is impossible to do anything without it. It is impossible to do anything without highly trained professionals in general. This is true for both highly trained engineering professionals as well as, incidentally, people who are simply working on modern assembly lines. Unfortunately, we do not have many such modern educational institutions, but they are emerging. I was happy to see how, for example, in St Petersburg, in a vocational school, they are training modern workers using the most advanced equipment, which, by the way, they bought in Germany and Switzerland. These are good professionals – absolutely world-class. So our goal is to diversify, and I tried to give a broad overview of the ways for diversification. I repeat, one of the key areas is improving business conditions. On this basis, on this foundation, we hope to attract capital: both our own domestic capital, even if it involves the repatriation of our domestic capital from abroad, and purely foreign capital. We created a Direct Investment Fund very recently. We agreed to capitalise it every year over the course of the next several years, and next year, we plan to inject add another 60 billion rubles in capital. The Fund has established direct contacts with all of the world’s major investment platforms and has just about begun its work. I think that this might also bring some very good momentum to the development, first and foremost, in high-tech areas of the economy.\", 'wordlist': ['good', 'afternoon', ',', 'friend', ',', 'lady',

Your meetings have become a beneficial and valuable tradition. This year, the St Petersburg Congress has brought together delegates from more than 90 countries, representing different generations of the millions-strong Russian community around the world. You share a common concern for Russia’s future and its people, a commitment to be useful to your historical homeland, to promote its socioeconomic development and strengthen its international authority and prestige. We highly value your contribution to the preservation of the Russian language and culture, the promotion of spiritual values that we share, the desire to disseminate around the world objective information about modern Russia, its history and achievements in education, science and technology. In turn, Russia always remembers its compatriots and is aware of the issues that concern you. Support for the Russian diaspora is one of the most important policies of our state. This is enshrined in the Federal Law On State Policy toward Compatriots Living Abroad. The law’s new edition stipulates that efforts are to be made to promote the unity of Russian communities abroad and to protect your rights and interests in accordance with international standards. This is a large and complex task, which we intend to tackle systemically and consistently, in close contact with all of you. Global and local coordinating councils of compatriots should play a major role. We actively work on improving communication with them, provide assistance, including financial aid, and support their print publications and online resources. We realise the importance of expanding the network of Russian centres of science and culture around the globe. Our plans include opening new consulates in the countries and regions with large Russian communities, particularly in the CIS. At the end of last year, we adopted a large-scale government programme to support compatriots for 2012 to 2014 and have allocated significant funding for its implementation. In January, the Foundation for Supporting and Protecting the Rights of Compatriots began to operate, through which qualified legal assistance is provided in cases when ethnic and cultural rights of Russians living in other countries are violated. Next year, an updated state programme for voluntary relocation of compatriots to Russia will come into force. It was prepared with due account for the programme’s previous experience, which was used by about 100,000 people. Assistance in moving to Russia will be provided for those who want to work or study in Russia, plan to open their own business as well as individuals with outstanding achievements in science, technology and culture, and with unique management experience. A key challenge is to preserve ethnic and cultural identity and to strengthen the position of the Russian language in other countries, especially in the former Soviet Union. This is the aim of The Russian Language federal programme, adopted for 2011–2015. The concept entitled The Russian School Abroad is currently being drafted. The Russian World Foundation extends financial support in the form of grants to Russian educational programmes. I would like to note the special role of the Russian Orthodox Church and other traditional religions in spiritual education and strengthening humanitarian and cultural ties between the Russian diaspora and its historical homeland. Young compatriots and their organisations abroad require special attention. It is necessary to assist them in carrying out youth festivals and gatherings, and to facilitate travel by young people to the historical places in our country. The Government has been instructed to increase the quota for the admission of compatriots in Russian universities and vocational colleges, and to finance their studies out of the federal budget. We look forward to seeing young representatives of the Russian diaspora working as interpreters and volunteers at the Universiade in Kazan in 2013, the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Your meetings have become a beneficial and valuable tradition. This year, the St Petersburg Congress has brought together delegates from more than 90 countries, representing different generations of the millions-strong Russian community around the world. You share a common concern for Russia’s future and its people, a commitment to be useful to your historical homeland, to promote its socioeconomic development and strengthen its international authority and prestige. We highly value your contribution to the preservation of the Russian language and culture, the promotion of spiritual values that we share, the desire to disseminate around the world objective information about modern Russia, its history and achievements in education, science and technology. In turn, Russia always remembers its compatriots and is aware of the issues that concern you. Support for the Russian diaspora is one of the most important policies of our state. This is enshrined in the Federal Law On State Policy toward Compatriots Living Abroad. The law’s new edition stipulates that efforts are to be made to promote the unity of Russian communities abroad and to protect your rights and interests in accordance with international standards. This is a large and complex task, which we intend to tackle systemically and consistently, in close contact with all of you. Global and local coordinating councils of compatriots should play a major role. We actively work on improving communication with them, provide assistance, including financial aid, and support their print publications and online resources. We realise the importance of expanding the network of Russian centres of science and culture around the globe. Our plans include opening new consulates in the countries and regions with large Russian communities, particularly in the CIS.

            "{'date': '2012-10-26T12:00:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': '* * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Let’s start by looking at the results of Aeroflot, Russia’s main carrier. What is the economic situation like and what is going on in the company? Do you think the passengers are happy? I would also like to hear about the low-cost air travel project. What has been done so far in this area? What kind of analysis has been carried out? I know that it seems some legislative amendments will have to be made. Let’s discuss this too. General Director of Aeroflot Vitaly Savelyev: Mr President, Aeroflot’s market share remains stable. We are carrying out the strategy approved by our Board of Directors. Our objective is to be among the top 5 European carriers and the top 20 global carriers by 2025. We have maintained leading positions in the services we provide, and we see this as very important. The latest IATA [International Air Transport Association] ratings put us in first place for business class in Europe, and in second place in economy class. There are some nuances to work on here and we will improve the situation this year. In the SkyTeam alliance we were first in economy class and kept our place in business class, and, for the first time ever, we were in first place for on-ground service too.  We have evaluated our loyalty index. We were the first civil aviation company to do so in 2010, as I told you. The passenger loyalty index, known as the NPS, showed that we have had an increase of 8 percent. This is a substantial increase because every one percent in growth represents an added $15 million to the company’s revenue.  Furthermore, our development strategy will see us establish Russia’s first aviation holding, to be created on the base of assets we have received from Rostekhnologii. The planes we buy are not cheap, and Aeroflot therefore cannot be a cheap airline. We have also maintained high catering standards and, according to the results for last December (this year’s assessment has not been made yet), we were third in the world for the quality of food we provide, as I reported to you last time we met. We will remain in this segment. Thus, Aeroflot will stay in the premium segment niche. Our current results and the services we provide to our passengers show that the company is in a stable situation economically. Our seat occupancy rate was up by almost three percent over the first three quarters of this year compared to the same period last year. Last year, we had a seat occupancy rate of 76 percent, but this year it is almost 79 percent. A one-percent increase in seat occupancy boosts our revenue by around 2 billion rubles, which is a substantial increase. What opportunities does this give us? First, we can invest in developing our subsidiary companies. Our subsidiaries provide passenger services that are around 20–25 percent cheaper than Aeroflot’s services. The big issue now, as your instruction, which we are acting on, made clear, is to establish a national low-cost airline. You are right in that we would need to change some laws, make some amendments to the Air Code, to be more precise, in order to establish this low-cost airline. We are ready to do this. If the amendments to the Air Code are made, we would be able to do it within six to twelve months at the most… Vladimir Putin: What amendments specifically? Vitaly Savelyev: First, we want to make an amendment to article 108 of the Air Code prohibiting passengers from selling non-returnable tickets. Countries all around the world apply this rule, in Europe, in America, but for some reason it does not apply here and this puts us in an uncompetitive situation. In other words, when passengers buy low-cost tickets they must be aware that these tickets cannot be returned. This applies not only to low-cost airlines but also to ordinary carriers, though to a lesser extent. The second amendment concerns article 56 of the Air Code and would allow us to hire non-resident pilots. This is important because all of the country’s airlines face a shortage of pilots today and there is a price war going on, with the airlines putting up prices and raising pilots’ wages. This will be a significant factor for the low-cost airline. An Aeroflot captain currently earns 420,000 [more than $13,000] a month. This, minus taxes, is the equivalent of a Lufthansa pilot. But if we had enough pilots and did not have to worry about a shortage, we could take real steps to regulate the conditions.  We also need to change the federal aviation rules. There are several amendments we need to pass. First, in case of low-cost airlines, passengers will need to pay for their baggage. At the moment, passengers can take 10 kilos of baggage cost-free. We also need to allow the low-cost airline not to be obliged to provide in-flight meals for passengers. At the moment, federal aviation rules prohibit this. Finally, the low-cost airline should have its own airport. There are several airports around Moscow that could serve as a hub for low-cost airlines and would be able to keep airport taxes to a minimum. Vladimir Putin: These are all issues we can discuss. Some of the points you mention are sensitive issues that concern the labour market above all, and that we need to consider carefully and discuss with the trade unions. But I think we should consider these matters. It would be right to establish a carrier of this type, because many passengers would be interested in using its services, which would be more affordable, more within the reach of all those who do not earn so much. I think this would be a big plus for the airline. Vitaly Savelyev: Yes, you are absolutely right. This is one of our priority development areas. I want to add that we are preparing for a new record in passenger traffic this year. We have carried more than 13 million passengers over the first 9 months of this year. Last year, we set an absolute record for Aeroflot with 14 million passengers for the year, but this year we have already reached 13.3 million. Also, Mr President, Aeroflot is in a financially stable situation today. According to the industry publication Air Transport World, we were in 10th place in the world last year for net profits, and 15th place for operating profit. In other words, the company is genuinely stable in its work and really is earning honest money.  We therefore propose the initiative, if you support it, of de-monopolising the air transport market, starting with ourselves. We want to set the example for all airlines in Russia. The domestic air transport market has already been liberalised and no one has a monopoly now. But many companies, including Aeroflot, still have monopoly routes when it comes to destinations abroad.  We want to take the initiative and set the example by renouncing our monopoly on 34 routes abroad. We would support having other Russian airlines come on to these routes in order to bring down prices, but we want at the same time to be able to operate more frequent flights. This would slightly lower our profit and revenue, but we think it would also bring down costs, and if you support the proposal, we are ready to take this step and renounce these routes. Vladimir Putin: Good, let’s discuss all of this in more detail. Overall, it seems to me like a good initiative. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16721, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting with General Director of Aeroflot Vitaly Savelyev', 'teaser': 'Aeroflot’s development programme and putting in place conditions for operation of low-cost airlines were the subjects of discussion.', 'tags': ['Transport'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Let’s start by looking at the results of Aeroflot, Russia’s main carrier.

This is the first meeting of the Council for Science and Education in its new composition. Roughly two-thirds of the membership has changed. I hope that we will also seriously update our work and its content too. This Council must become a platform for open dialogue with the science community in order to produce concrete recommendations on the main state policy areas. After all, it is the level of technological, scientific, and education development and the quality of human resources in the broadest sense that determines leadership in today’s world. Our common task is to carry out a steady and consistent policy that draws on the best in Russian and global experience to give our country an education and science environment that meets the demands of today’s world and the needs of our strategic development priorities. The Council should focus on addressing these objectives with the support of competent opinions from the country’s academic community and giving consideration to all constructive ideas that are realistic in Russia’s situation. Today we will look at the important matter of financial support for science and how to make the instruments we use in this area more effective and produce better results. They should raise the returns on investment in science. Federal budget funding for civilian sector science has increased substantially over the last 10 years, but we often hear the view and have the idea that there is not enough money for science. This is fair enough. At the same time however, let me draw your attention to a few figures. In 2002, we spent only 31 billion rubles [$1 billion] on science, but we are spending 328 billion rubles on it this year. This is a big difference. Public sector average wages in research and development have almost tripled over the last 5 years, from 9,700 rubles [$320] a month in 2006, to 27,869 rubles a month in 2011 which is 21 percent higher than the average wage in the economy as a whole. Of course, it is still not much, but the trend is clear and positive at least. Russia is one of the top countries in the world now for the absolute volume of state funding for research and development. Put into purchasing power parity terms, our figure comes out at $22 billion. Comparing this to the OECD countries’ respective figures, we are still a long way behind the United States ($157 billion), Japan ($33 billion) and Germany ($29 billion), but are ahead of countries such as France, Britain, and Italy, which have figures of $19 billion, $14 billion, and $11 billion respectively in purchasing power parity terms. A number of our research institutes and teams are at the global forefront in their fields and enjoy a deserved reputation around the world. The programme to attract prominent scientists to Russian universities and laboratories is also starting to produce results. More than 70 research projects involving the participation of foreign specialists and Russians returning home to work are underway now. I already mentioned on several occasions, including at the opening of the new Federal University, about the grant support programme that aims to attract globally recognised scientists and offers laboratories, accommodation, and decent pay. We had ten applicants for every one place on the programme, with applications coming from the USA, Europe, Japan, and South Korea. In general, I think we are moving in the right direction. Of course, this is still not enough and we must go further and ensure steady development and a new quality of work in research and development in Russia. Regrettably, the share of Russian authors in international academic publications and the number of citations of Russian research around the world continue to fall, and the number of patents issued is still not high. We are entirely justified in asking why the increase in budget funding has still not brought results in the form of patents, new technology and innovation. But the academic community for its part often says that this budget money is enough only to survive, not to develop. In some segments this is indeed the case, but to be objective, it is not the case throughout the sector as a whole. I think that achieving any sort of effective results will require maximum clarity and precision in all matters concerning state support for science. We need a clear logic focused on obtaining results and on making budget spending on science more effective. We will have to adjust budget instruments, better target their objectives and use, develop a differentiated approach to supporting and financing the various stages of the research cycle, and establish clear and transparent links between scientific results and rewards for scientists. At the same time, we also need to give young researchers opportunities for creative growth and realising their professional potential, and provide them with decent living standards. We are to encourage a transition to multichannel financing for research, with funds coming not just from the state budget but also from extra-budgetary sources, business, private companies. Many of you know the role the different channels play in funding for science in the world’s big research powerhouses. In Japan, for example, budget money accounts for only 23 percent of funding for science, while here it represents almost 75 percent. Naturally, these new approaches will have to be introduced gradually, without radical upheaval to the existing instruments and institutions and realising that for now, budget money will remain the biggest source of funding for research and development in Russia. I have several proposals to make in this context. First, the basic research and development instrument — the state objectives – is in need of serious change.  Currently, around three quarters or even more of the money allocated is spent on paying wages, utilities costs, and regular maintenance – routine expenses, in other words. This means that there is obviously not enough money for serious research, buying equipment and materials, and developing the infrastructure. When setting the tasks to be carried out under the state objectives, there must be a clear separation between maintaining and developing the science infrastructure and the research and development work itself. We also need to aim for a regular 5–10 year cycle of upgrading the equipment and technical base at research and education establishments. The way the funding system works at the moment it is focused on using the money from the state budget, gives only secondary attention to actually getting results out of research and development work and does not create incentives for developing the needed competition in science. One possible solution would be a shift to a system of permanent and short-term contracts as part of the state objectives framework. We could offer permanent contracts to prominent scientists and researchers who achieve high results in their work, while others would work under a system of short-term contracts, joining strong teams for specific projects or research themes. Financing for institutions of established world renown must be guaranteed on an ongoing basis, as part of their medium-term development programmes, for example. Second, we need a new quality of modern grant financing for science. This is an effective instrument that has already proven its worth abroad and here in Russia. But the current kinds of short-term grants we have here do not enable us to give the full needed support for all projects. Essentially, grant funding is just an addition to researchers’ and post-graduates’ basic pay. This money is enough for attending an academic conference or buying a bit of equipment, but it would be practically impossible to carry out a big project from start to finish and obtain significant scientific results. You know about our decision to considerably increase the national science humanities foundations’ resources. We plan to allocate up to 25 billion rubles [ $800 million] a year for this purpose by 2018. We have already gone through all the details with the Finance Ministry and there should be no speculative talk that we are spending too much money and the budget will collapse as a result. Nothing is about to collapse. The matter has been planned and analysed. True, the organisational and legal form for further use of these funds has not been settled yet, but this is a matter for separate discussions in the Government or between the Government and the Presidential Executive Office. In principle, we could look at setting up some kind of additional bodies that would oversee grant support, all the more so as the grant system has proven its effectiveness. We have to modernise our grant policy in order to ensure that the funds invested bring maximum return. As I just said, we need to focus it on supporting medium-term research and full-cycle big projects in areas that can produce results of a global level. I also think it is important to shift research work undertaken as part of the federal targeted programmes over to a grant-funded basis. In this context we could discuss establishing specialised funds for supporting research and education activities. Third, world practice shows that most applied research and projects are carried out with the help of extra-budgetary funding. I just mentioned Japan’s example. But many Russian organisations have only very limited possibilities in this area, especially if we are talking about non-commercial, fundamental research. Targeted capital funds are an effective means of attracting private money into science and education. We have a law in this area that is in force and working, and we now have 70 such funds with total capital of 4 billion roubles. This is not enough and we realise that this is still far too little for us to be able to talk yet about serious private financing for scientific research. This makes it all the more important for the state authorities to encourage the establishment and development of such funds. I propose that we discuss all of these issues today in order to start moving forward. Thank you for your attention. <…> Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, We have considered one of the key issues in the organisation of scientific activities in the Russian Federation: the issue of funding. It is clear that no task can be addressed without funding, so the question is how to organise it. We have seen that although the available funding may not be sufficient, it is nevertheless significant. Keeping in mind the Government’s intention to increase this funding, we must take a very close look today (as some colleagues have said) at ways to attract funding and the results of our joint efforts. I agree that such assessment is not simple and it is not one-dimensional. It is clear that here, just like in any creative or academic endeavour, the approach to this assessment should be highly accurate, balanced and professional. However, it would be impossible to do away with the assessment. We will certainly take your comments and suggestions into account in formulating the final version of this meeting’s outcome document. I want to draw your attention to the fact that the Minister [of Education and Science Dmitry Livanov] said, and I want to support him in this, that many things are already available for use within the existing regulatory framework, although I also agree with those who believe that it should be improved. All of this will be the subject of our future work, bearing in mind the plan of our joint activities that was proposed by Mr Fursenko [Aide to the President, Deputy Chairman of the Council for Science and Education]. Thank you very much for your work and for taking part in today’s meeting.', 'kremlin_id': 16726, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting of the Council for Science and Education', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin held the first meeting of the Council for Science and Education since its membership was changed.', 'tags': ['Professional training', 'Science and innovation'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, colleagues. This is the first meeting of the Council for Science and Education in its new composition. Roughly two-thirds of the membership has changed. I hope that we will also seriously update our work and its content too. This Council must become a platform for open dialogue with the science community in order to produce concrete recommendations on the main state policy areas. After all, it is the level of technological, scientific, and education development and the quality of human resources in the broadest sense that determines leadership in today’s world. Our common task is to carry out a steady and consistent policy that draws on the best in Russian and global experience to give our country an education and science environment that meets the demands of today’s world and the needs of our strategic development priorities. The Council should focus on addressing these objectives with the support of competent opinions from the country’s academic community and giving consideration to all constructive ideas that are realistic in Russia’s situation. Today we will look at the important matter of financial support for science and how to make the instruments we use in this area more effective and produce better results. They should raise the returns on investment in science. Federal budget funding for civilian sector science has increased substantially over the last 10 years, but we often hear the view and have the idea that there is not enough money for science. This is fair enough. At the same time however, let me draw your attention to a few figures. In 2002, we spent only 31 billion rubles [$1 billion] on science, but we are spending 328 billion rubles on it this year. This is a big difference. Public sector average wages in research and development have almost tripled over the last 5 years, from 9,700 rubles [$320] a month in 2006, to 27,869 rubles a month in 2011 which is 21 percent higher than the average wage in the economy as a whole. Of course, it is still not much, but the trend is clear and positive at least. Russia is one of the top countries in the world now for the absolute volume of state funding for research and development. Put into purchasing power parity terms, our figure comes out at $22 billion. Comparing this to the OECD countries’ respective figures, we are still a long way behind the United States ($157 billion), Japan ($33 billion) and Germany ($29 billion), but are ahead of countries such as France, Britain, and Italy, which have figures of $19 billion, $14 billion, and $11 billion respectively in purchasing power parity terms. A number of our research institutes and teams are at the global forefront in their fields and enjoy a deserved reputation around the world. The programme to attract prominent scientists to Russian universities and laboratories is also starting to produce results. More than 70 research projects involving the participation of foreign specialists and Russians returning home to work are underway now. I already mentioned on several occasions, including at the opening of the new Federal University, about the grant support programme that aims to attract globally recognised scientists and offers laboratories, accommodation, and decent pay. We had ten applicants for every one place on the programme, with applications coming from the USA, Europe, Japan, and South Korea. In general, I think we are moving in the right direction. Of course, this is still not enough and we must go further and ensure steady development and a new quality of work in research and development in Russia. Regrettably, the share of Russian authors in international academic publications and the number of citations of Russian research around the world continue to fall, and the number of patents issued is still not high. We are entirely justified in asking why the increase in budget funding has still not brought results in the form of patents, new technology and innovation. But the academic community for its part often says that this budget money is enough only to survive, not to develop. In some segments this is indeed the case, but to be objective, it is not the case throughout the sector as a whole. I think that achieving any sort of effective results will require maximum clarity and precision in all matters concerning state support for science. We need a clear logic focused on obtaining results and on making budget spending on science more effective. We will have to adjust budget instruments, better target their objectives and use, develop a differentiated approach to supporting and financing the various stages of the research cycle, and establish clear and transparent links between scientific results and rewards for scientists. At the same time, we also need to give young researchers opportunities for creative growth and realising their professional potential, and provide them with decent living standards. We are to encourage a transition to multichannel financing for research, with funds coming not just from the state budget but also from extra-budgetary sources, business, private companies. Many of you know the role the different channels play in funding for science in the world’s big research powerhouses. In Japan, for example, budget money accounts for only 23 percent of funding for science, while here it represents almost 75 percent. Naturally, these new approaches will have to be introduced gradually, without radical upheaval to the existing instruments and institutions and realising that for now, budget money will remain the biggest source of funding for research and development in Russia. I have several proposals to make in this context. First, the basic research and development instrument — the state objectives – is in need of serious change.  Currently, around three quarters or even more of the money allocated is spent on paying wages, utilities costs, and regular maintenance – routine expenses, in other words. This means that there is obviously not enough money for serious research, buying equipment and materials, and developing the infrastructure. When setting the tasks to be carried out under the state objectives, there must be a clear separation between maintaining and developing the science infrastructure and the research and development work itself. We also need to aim for a regular 5–10 year cycle of upgrading the equipment and technical base at research and education establishments. The way the funding system works at the moment it is focused on using the money from the state budget, gives only secondary attention to actually getting results out of research and development work and does not create incentives for developing the needed competition in science. One possible solution would be a shift to a system of permanent and short-term contracts as part of the state objectives framework. We could offer permanent contracts to prominent scientists and researchers who achieve high results in their work, while others would work under a system of short-term contracts, joining strong teams for specific projects or research themes. Financing for institutions of established world renown must be guaranteed on an ongoing basis, as part of their medium-term development programmes, for example. Second, we need a new quality of modern grant financing for science. This is an effective instrument that has already proven its worth abroad and here in Russia. But the current kinds of short-term grants we have here do not enable us to give the full needed support for all projects.

Once again, I congratulate you and everybody who brought this programme to this level. Today, I want to discuss with you an equally important matter, namely, the Eastern Gas Programme’s development. We drafted and adopted this programme back in 2007. Gazprom has accomplished a lot since then, establishing two big production centres, one on Kamchatka peninsula and one on Sakhalin island. Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Khabarovsk, and Vladivostok have all been connected to the gas network now, and projects to develop pipeline transport are underway.  Now the second stage of the programme is ready to begin with the start of work to develop fields in Yakutia and Irkutsk Region – the fields of Chayanda and Kovykta. These are international-level fields in terms of their reserves. I remind you that we agreed that once the work there begins, we will carry out our plans to develop new transport possibilities and build at least two new pipeline systems. I also remind you that we agreed that the gas from these fields would go primarily for domestic needs, but given that these deposits have huge reserves – we have 3.5 trillion cubic metres of gas overall here – we could also set up another export centre focused on the Asia-Pacific region, an area in which we should concentrate above all on developing liquefied natural gas exports. Let me remind you that we are developing shipbuilding capacity in the Far East with a view to placing orders for gas transport ships at Russian shipyards. I would like to hear from you now on the situation with the second stage of work, and what Gazprom plans to do and when. Go ahead. Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller     Miller AlexeiGazprom CEO : Mr President, Gazprom is working steadily on carrying out the Eastern Gas Programme. We have established two production centres on Kamchatka and Sakhalin and have built two mainline gas pipelines – the Sobolevo-Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky pipeline, and the Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok pipeline.  Gazprom is continuing its work on Sakhalin. In 2013, a new field, the Kirinskoye field, will come into operation. This field is unique in that production there will be carried out using the bottom-sediment layer production method for the first time in Russia. Of course, Mr President, now that the work on developing the Sakhalin and Kamchatka fields is underway, we will set our sights on carrying out the second stage of the programme and developing new gas production centres, above all in Yakutia and Irkutsk region. Vladimir Putin: Kovykta is in Irkutsk and the gas production centre in Yakutia is Chayanda? Alexei Miller: That’s right, Chayanda is the main gas field in the Yakutia production centre. Total onshore deposits in Eastern Siberia and the Far East amount to 53 trillion cubic metres of gas, and the adjacent shelf has 15 trillion. Vladimir Putin: And how much gas does Irkutsk have? Alexei Miller: Deposits of Irkutsk gas production centre amount to 3.7 billion cubic metres. The Chayanda field has 1.2 trillion cubic metres of gas. Geological research on the region is extremely limited: only 8% of onshore deposits and 6% of shelf deposits have been explored. Vladimir Putin: Are you planning to build the pipeline from Yakutia to the east first? Alexei Miller: Our first priority is to start work on the Chayanda field, the second stage will be developing the Irkutsk gas production centre and the Kovykta filed, and the third stage is the Krasnoyarsk centre. After work starts at the Chayanda field, we plan to build a pipeline from Yakutia to Vladivostok via Khabarovsk (the pipeline length will be 3,200 kilometres). At the same time as we develop the Kovykta field, we will start building the second part of the pipeline from Yakutia (its length will be 800 kilometres). Vladimir Putin: This is to connect the two fields. Are you going to build a pipeline to the west? Alexei Miller: There is an option to supply gas in the future from the Irkutsk gas production centre to the west, in the direction of Krasnoyarsk, Novosibirsk and Omsk (over 2,000 kilometres of pipelines). Thus, we plan to connect the eastern part of the country, Eastern Siberia with Western Siberia, the main consumption centre. Vladimir Putin: This way you will create a unified system of gas supply. Alexei Miller: A unified gas supply system for the entire country. The investment feasibility study for the Chayanda field has been completed, as well as the feasibility study for the pipeline from Yakutia to Vladivostok via Khabarovsk. With regard to the priority of the Eastern Gas Programme, the supply of gas to the domestic market (this is how Gazprom is organising its work), we have developed master plans for gas supply to 11 regions in this part of the country and signed the relevant agreements with the local administrations. Of course, we realise that this is a two-way street, and the local and regional authorities should be working to prepare the consumers for receiving gas and building gas distribution facilities. As you know, gas in Eastern Siberia is multicomponent – there is significant share of ethane, propane, helium. Vladimir Putin: So it is necessary to develop the gas processing industry. Alexei Miller: We therefore must develop the gas processing industry at the same time. Given that Gazprom does not consider gas processing its priority at the moment, investment should come from the companies that specialise in this field. They must develop capacities simultaneously, in parallel with the work on the Chayanda field and the gas transportation system. Vladimir Putin: Now please report on the timing. Alexei Miller: The deadlines are as follows. The feasibility study has been approved. As for the pipeline, we believe that it could be built by the end of 2017. In that case, we could also talk about building an LNG plant near Vladivostok with the understanding that while the domestic market is our priority, we are also focusing, as you said today, on creating a new centre for exporting Russian gas to Asia-Pacific countries. As you know, this market has the biggest capacity in the world and is rapidly developing. The markets of China, India, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Bangladesh, Singapore, and Vietnam are growing very fast. This opens up great prospects, and in the near future we will be able to build up our gas exporting capacity to an extent that it will be comparable to gas supplies to Europe, and may even surpass them. Vladimir Putin: Mr Miller, are you planning to build the pipeline junction from the Chayanda field or a separate one to Vladivostok? Alexei Miller: No, we will build it to Vladivostok. Vladimir Putin: How many kilometres are you planning? Alexei Miller: 3,200. Vladimir Putin: And it will be launched at the end of 2017? Alexei Miller: Yes, it will. It will take five years, given the fact that the feasibility study is ready. Vladimir Putin: And how many kilometres from Irkutsk? Alexei Miller: 800. Vladimir Putin: Well, that’s a small job. Alexei Miller: The gas pipeline is designed to go along the Eastern Siberia — Pacific Ocean oil pipeline. This will optimise the cost of infrastructure and energy supply. As for the gas pipelines from Irkutsk to Yakutia and from Yakutia to Vladivostok via Khabarovsk, the question of choosing a name for the gas mains supply network becomes relevant. Vladimir Putin: See what you can come up with and announce a competition online. People who are interested in the development of the Russia’s east will send you their proposals. Alexei Miller: We will, Mr President. <…> We are planning to focus on the export of pipeline gas in the second stage of the project, after the plant is completed and long-term contracts for the supply of liquefied natural gas from Russia are signed. Vladimir Putin: How much investment will you attract in the Irkutsk project? What is the approximate figure of investment in the development of fields in the Irkutsk Region and how much will the gas pipeline network cost? Alexei Miller: I can give you the figures based on the feasibility study for Chayanda and the gas pipeline to Vladivostok. The field development will cost 430 billion rubles [$14 billion], and around 770 billion rubles will be invested in the construction of a gas pipeline. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16731, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller', 'teaser': 'The meeting discussed implementation of the Eastern Gas Programme, development of the Chayanda and Kovykta gas fields in Siberia, construction of pipeline transport routes, developing a unified gas supply system for the country, and developing the gas-chemicals sector.', 'tags': ['Energy', 'Energy efficiency'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Mr Miller, you recently started work at the big Bovanenkovo field.

Today the Russian Railways   Background information Russian Railways    is marking 175 years since its foundation and I want to congratulate the company’s leadership and all railway workers. This is a significant event in the history of our country. Railway workers and the railways have played a crucial role in the development of Russia’s economy and continue to play a colossal role. No other mode of transport has come close in providing transportation for a country with such a vast territory as Russia. Most cargo volumes are still transported by rail. I want to look back at the World War II years and the earlier periods of industrialisation and collectivisation. Those were very complicated periods that evoke a mixed response today, but they were certainly large-scale. The industrialisation was undoubtedly a very significant event for the development of our economy. Without the vital role played by the railways it would have been impossible to achieve the goals the nation had set for itself. During World War II railways transported massive amounts of equipment to the east, delivered the required quantities in the right time to the frontlines, and did it all in extremely difficult conditions – this demanded great professionalism and courage of railway workers. Next year the Russian Union of Transport Workers will mark its 10th anniversary. It is a fairly young association, but it is very large in terms of the challenges it addresses and the people it unites, which includes almost all transportation workers in our country: aviation, road, river and sea transport. I am very grateful to the Union of Transport Workers for their active support of the Russian Popular Front, their essential role in the presidential election and participation in the State Duma elections, in which they won seats on a United Russian ticket. Now they have an opportunity to have a direct impact on the legislative process. I am sure we will address many issues at our meeting today, although this is almost a celebratory event, so I hope you won’t attack me with particularly complex matters, but nevertheless, this meeting will also have a working part. I want to say straight away that the Union of Transport Workers representatives are members of the State Duma, and if you ask me about improving legislation, I will forward all such questions to them. Seriously, the Union of Transport Workers indeed plays a vitally important role in ensuring the proper operation and functioning of the Russian transport industry and is directly involved in drafting laws and regulations. We do not always succeed in reaching full consensus but nevertheless, the Government always listens to the opinions of the Union of Transport Workers and always looks for and finds compromises. I very much hope that we will continue to work side by side with the Union of Transport Workers on the development of our strategies, or rather, on correcting them if the need arises. The Union of Transport Workers participated in drafting the Russian Transport Strategy until 2030. Hopefully, we will continue our joint efforts not only on conceptual tasks, but also on current issues.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, Governor of Lipetsk Region Oleg Korolev and Head of Chuvashia Mikhail Ignatyev took part in the meeting via videoconference.  * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, Today, we will discuss the situation with implementing the healthcare modernisation programme. Let me remind you that the programme was drafted for the 2011–2012 period and is still in progress, but I think this is a good moment to review what has been achieved so far and what still needs to be done, since there is still work to carry out, which I will speak about in a minute. Overall though, the work is going according to plan. We need to sum up the interim results and are in a position to do so now. Our healthcare sector goals are well known. Our top priorities are to improve public healthcare services and public health in general, increase life expectancy, reduce mortality, and improve the demographic situation. These are all extremely important tasks for the country. Of course, we can only achieve these goals if we have modern medical facilities and equipment and top-quality healthcare professionals. The quality of healthcare services depends above all on the professional skills and qualifications of the healthcare sector workers and their responsible attitude towards their work and their patients. They should receive decent pay for their work. One of the objectives we follow in introducing standards in the sector is to ensure that healthcare workers will indeed earn more money based on the principle that higher quality work should be better paid.  Gradual increases in healthcare sector wages continue. By 2018, we plan that doctors’ average wages will be double the average wage in the region they work in. I will not list the regions where wages have risen and give you the corresponding figures, but an increase really is taking place. It would be nice to have a bigger increase perhaps, but overall, there is progress here.  Of course, the regional programmes’ biggest priority is to upgrade hospitals and medical centres, as well as healthcare facilities in rural areas, buy new diagnostic and therapeutic equipment, and spread the use of information technology that will make it simpler to make doctors’ appointments and save doctors from extra paperwork and people from having to spend time waiting in lines. I remind you that we have allocated an additional 460 billion rubles for these purposes over 2011 and 2012. Added to this is the 174 billion rubles allocated by the regions. This gives us a total of around 630 billion rubles, which is slightly less than the funding for the priority healthcare programme we were carrying out over the previous years. The figures are comparable however. The priority healthcare programme had funding of slightly more than 700 billion rubles. The programmes’ implementation has considerably improved the healthcare situation in the regions. Of course, all of this investment has to be put to effective work and bring maximum returns.  Let me remind you that our plans call for the construction of 107 new healthcare facilities, and for capital renovation of more than 3,500 existing facilities. We also need to purchase equipment for 5,500 medical institutions.  As you all realise, we have not much time left before the completion deadline. In this respect, I ask the regional heads to keep strictly to the timetable, including for purchases of medical equipment. All contract formalities should be completed very soon. The situation varies from region to region. We all have the information before us and so I will not go through it case by case. I would like to hear during this meeting on the state of progress in implementing the programmes, the contracts’ performance, and whether everything will be completed on time. If there are problems and glitches of any sort, let’s discuss them here and now and reflect on what we can do to fix the situation. The main thing is that I want to hear about the actual results: how much have equipment and facilities actually improved, how much do hospitals and medical centres measure up to modern demands, and what improvement has there been to the quality of service our people receive? I want to hear reports from our colleagues in the regions on the changes in the local healthcare provision system. Mr Sobyanin [Mayor of Moscow] is at Moscow’s First City Hospital. We visited this hospital last year, as I recall, and looked at the situation there. We have also linked up to the President of the Republic of Chuvashia and the Governor of Lipetsk Region.  I want to stress also that our efforts to raise the quality of public healthcare services must not end with the formal completion of healthcare modernisation programmes in the regions. The Government now has the task of drafting and implementing the long-term Healthcare Development national programme. I expect active work to continue at the regional level too, building on the experience and results of the 2011–2012 healthcare modernisation programmes of course.

President of The Russian Academy of Sciences YURY OSIPOV: That’s right. Vladimir Putin: Let’s start with that. Yury Osipov: As you know, this institute was created back in the Soviet era by the Politburo. It did some very good work, considering that mathematics, both in the Soviet times and in modern Russia, have held leading positions in the world. It was based in Leningrad, in St Petersburg. The institute operated as follows: Russian and foreign researchers would come for six or twelve months and give lectures and seminars, attracting undergraduate and postgraduate students, and PhD candidates. In general, this system worked well until the early 1990s, when it fell apart because of a lack of funds. I believe we must revive this institution; this is very important. First, some of our outstanding mathematicians who have moved abroad have written to me saying that they are willing to come and work in Russia. Some of them may even return for good. And they don’t need much: all that is necessary is to build a small hotel. Vladimir Putin: Comfortable accommodation. Yury Osipov: Yes, so that the people who come here have somewhere reasonable to stay. It should be a flat, or rather an apartment hotel with 15 to 20 flats, located near the institute. If you support this initiative, I will supply all the details in writing to you or your assistants. Vladimir Putin: Please do. Yury Osipov: Thank you, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Agreed. YURY OSIPOV There’s another issue I wanted to bring up. You have set the goal for several of our universities to move up to the top one hundred in the academic ranking of world universities in the near future. When this ranking is compiled, most of the points are awarded to universities for their achievements in science; they get more than 50% of points for this area. As you know, for example, Novosibirsk State University was established by the Academy of Sciences which has an excellent branch [Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences] there and most of the teaching is conducted through the branch. Then there is Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology in Dolgoprudny, also created by the Academy, and it has a lot of our departments. Of course, St Petersburg Academic University headed Zhores Alferov is also an excellent university. Vladimir Putin: It’s great the way he has organised it. Yury Osipov: Mr President, we have conducted an assessment recently and he took first place with 100 points in science. We still need to think this through but I think with your support we could establish an integrated university based there. Perhaps we could even establish a department at the Academy that would oversee education. Believe me, such a university would quickly find itself among the world leaders because it would be made up of top research universities. Vladimir Putin: Let’s try this, especially since the Academy has the opportunity. You could combine research and education. Yury Osipov: Absolutely. Everything is ready, all that remains is just to formalise it. Vladimir Putin: Mr Alferov has the different stages of education – school and university – packed into a single system. Yury Osipov: Mr President, I also have some good news. Last year the Government allocated us some money for housing. Vladimir Putin: Housing for young scientists. Yury Osipov: Yes, certificates and money for the purchase of housing. However, as I reported to you earlier, we couldn’t do it in Moscow because it is too expensive. We implemented an old investment project and received from the Federal Agency for State Property Management (Rosimushchestvo) a whole building in Odintsovo with 224 flats. Therefore, the Academy of Sciences has provided 997 flats to young researchers this year. This is a very good result. Now the Housing Construction Development Facilitation Fund has become actively involved. As you said yourself, new housing will be built in Siberia. In short, there has been some progress and we are very happy about that. Vladimir Putin: The main thing is not to rest on your laurels. Yury Osipov: I hope we won’t. Most importantly, this inspires real enthusiasm in young people. Vladimir Putin: That’s good. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16745, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting with Yury Osipov', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with President of the Russian Academy of Sciences Yury Osipov.', 'tags': ['Science and innovation'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Mr Osipov, I know that you wanted to talk first about the Euler International Mathematical Institute.

Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky     Medinsky VladimirAide to the President  presented the decorations. * * * Speech at a reception marking National Unity Day  President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends. Congratulations on the National Unity Day! This is our newest national holiday, but its roots go back deep in time to events that played a defining role in our country’s history. Four hundred years ago, our people ended the Time of Troubles, a period which had seen our country weakened. Any other outcome would have left Russia in danger of losing its independence and deprived our nation of its historical perspectives, culture, and spiritual uniqueness. The Russian people took their destiny in their hands then. They united in the name of Russia, in the name of their Motherland, putting aside differences of social class, ethnicity and religion, and showing that there are values and goals of such brightness and importance that all else pales in comparison. The people freed Moscow from the foreign interventionist forces and from those who had sold and betrayed Russia, and then, acting of their own free will, they established strong and effective government in the country. The spirit of unity and creation is woven through the entire fabric of Russian history. Its might built and united a great nation. It made enemies retreat, put an end to internal quarrels and strife, and thwarted attempts to conquer and bring our country to its knees. The twists and turns of history have tested the solidity of Russia’s foundations, but our people’s unity, based on love for the native land and responsibility for its fate, has always won in the end. This unity has always been a sure support for our country and I’m sure always will be.  2012, which was declared the Year of Russian History, is rich in important dates. In September, we marked the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Borodino and the 1150th anniversary of the founding of Russian statehood, and now we are celebrating the 400th anniversary of the victory that ended the Time of Troubles. Over the centuries, Russia has had its share of successes, mistakes, and victories, and today is once more gaining strength and influence in the world. We have our eyes on the future, but at the same time, we will always remember our past and do everything we can to keep the links of time alive.  As we celebrate this holiday today, we all sense the uninterrupted flow of centuries, this long road that Russia has travelled, and we know that we are the direct inheritors of the common cause to which our forebears dedicated their lives. We know that we must honour and preserve their traditions, traditions such as genuine deep-rooted patriotism and mutual respect between peoples. These values help to consolidate our society today too, and create the foundation upon which we can build up our democracy and civic awareness, strengthening our country and our civic solidarity.  Pyotr Stolypin [1862–1911, a statesman in the Russian Empire] rightly considered the state to be the irreplaceable power that takes its source in the people and history and works for their interests. He said that the state, in carrying out the people’s wishes and developing cultural traditions, subordinates the rights of particular individuals and groups to the rights of the whole, and the whole as he saw it was Russia itself.  His words are still just as relevant today. What’s more, in our modern world, an effectively functioning state is more important than ever. The international community has already realised that weakening and eroding the institution of national state sovereignty ends up threatening everyone’s security and that only equal dialogue between sovereign states on the basis of international law will always be the main factor in preserving global stability. Friends! It is tradition that at the reception we hold on this day we are joined by our compatriots from abroad. We know that for you, Russia is more than simply the land of your forebears. You share in full measure its concerns and problems and take a real interest and involvement in its fate. This is what makes the Russian community abroad unique, and we have a duty to preserve its traditions and heritage. We are united by the deepest and most fervent emotion – love of and belief in Russia.  We value the contribution our compatriots abroad, and foreign citizens too, make to developing friendship and cooperation with our country. We have enormous respect for your freely expressed desire to be true friends and patriots of our country, and we support your multifaceted work to preserve the Russian world’s space and encourage partnership-based and humanitarian projects. In recognition of your services, I ask the Minister of Culture of the Russian Federation [Vladimir Medinsky] to present you with the state decorations you have earned.  Thank you for your attention.

Indeed, a great deal has been achieved already. I will draw on the support of military personnel, the people who have been nurtured by the army, have done a lot for it and continue to serve in the Armed Forces today. Thank you again. I will do my best to justify your confidence. Vladimir Putin: Certainly, the Armed Forces have very strong personnel and a huge intellectual potential, and it is essential to exploit this potential to the full. You were only recently appointed Governor of the Moscow Region and have already laid the groundwork to address a number of issues facing the region, and there are many challenges in every sphere, including financial, economic and social. You have put together an efficient team. I hope that the future governor, who will be elected by the region’s residents, although this will happen only a year from now, will be able to continue these efforts. In the near future, I will make the decision on who will be appointed acting governor of the Moscow Region. I wish you every success in your new post.

Other issues discussed included the preparation of Russian national teams for international competitions, training of sports reserve, as well as staffing sports schools. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, Today’s meeting of the Council is devoted to the preparation of our national teams for major international competitions. All of us want Russia to have major, memorable sports victories. We need them because they help to boost moral fortitude and patriotism at home and strengthen our nation’s prestige abroad. Most importantly, such events promote a healthy and active lifestyle and make sport the top choice of millions of our citizens, especially young people. Therefore, now at the start of the next Olympic cycle, we must clearly define our priorities and the logic of our actions. Above all, we must conduct a comprehensive analysis of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The experience of those games should become our guide to action so to speak. You must look and analyse once again the athletes’ performances, and the way their training programme was reflected in the results. We all know that sports victories are achieved through long and intensive training. The results achieved at competitions demonstrate the effectiveness of training programmes. The 2012 Olympics were no exception. We witnessed the achievements of sports federations and regional organisations; we saw where the training programmes were exceptional, where they fell short and where they were clearly unsatisfactory. Competition in world sports, and all of us know this, is becoming tougher every year. Today it goes beyond competition between athletes and coaching schools. All the participants involved in training athletes also take part in the struggle, including coaches, managers, teachers, scientists and healthcare workers. Those who are able to take advantage of the entire range of modern methods and opportunities, those who provide quality training at each step on the way to victory are the ones who make it to the pedestal. According to the plans developed by sports federations and the Sports Ministry, Russian athletes should be able to win gold medals in 20 out of 37 Olympic sports, but the performances at London Olympics did not meet these high expectations. Now it is extremely important to take steps to help our athletes achieve success and represent Russia with honour at the world’s sporting arenas. One of our main objectives is to train a sports reserve. This issue is closely linked to the general physical fitness of children and young people. There have been some achievements in this area in recent years; we have seen a growth in the number of stadiums, swimming pools, sports fields and clubs. However, for the majority of children – I want to stress that I am talking about the majority – there are still not enough opportunities to engage in sports. This is a nationwide problem, and not a sectoral one. I firmly believe it could be addressed much faster with a more proactive, involved and aggressive position of the Sports Ministry and the Education Ministry. We need to build a comprehensive system that would primarily contribute to the development of sports skills in children and make it easier to identify gifted athletes from an early age, starting with pre-schools, which have practically no physical education lessons as things stand. The situation is not much better at schools. We have introduced an additional physical education lesson per week, but the training programme has not been adjusted. A purely formal approach remains common, despite the fact that it has not been very effective in promoting widespread involvement in fitness and sports among children, and therefore slowed down their choice of a particular sport they could engage and succeed in later. Clearly, this situation must be turned around. Sport among university students must be taken to a qualitatively new level, and I have talked about this many times. I ask the Education Minister to report today on the implementation of these decisions. Now for the sports schools. Today Russia has 52 Olympic reserve schools, 984 specialised Olympic reserve schools and 3,831 sports schools for children and teenagers. In total, they train over 3.1 million young people but even more children could become involved. We have 317 fewer specialised schools than we had in 2007. Nobody can be satisfied with this negative trend. I would like to stress that a single agency should be responsible for all Olympic reserve schools; it will be in charge of their financial security and the quality of training programmes. Therefore, it is necessary to complete the transition of specialised schools to the Sports Ministry. We've already talked about this and have received numerous requests from people across the country. The most important factor in the general education system is the multifaceted development of an individual, whereas here we are dealing with special schools, so they should focus on sport and on training athletes capable of achieving outstanding results in the future. The Ministry should also be in charge of Olympic reserve schools. We should also think about the format for the Ministry’s involvement in the activities of children’s sports schools. The next issue concerns the condition and equipment of sports facilities where athletes train. As you know, this is an area where a great deal has been done in recent years. New modern facilities have appeared, and I have seen them for myself and have taken part in planning them and monitored the construction process. The Sports Ministry has done some good work here, but we have to admit that there are not enough such sports facilities, and many athletes are forced to train abroad. Paralympic athletes also have problems with training for the Games. The swimmers and track and field athletes, who compete for 318 medals out of 503, had problems with finding time for practice. It was not easy for them because all the training facilities were booked up by the Olympic teams. Our objective is to build a sufficient number of training centres by 2015 and to supply them with modern equipment. I ask the Sports Minister to tell us today how this initiative has been progressing. I know that these plans are in place, the funding has been allocated and the work is in progress. How effective is it? The issue of coaching staff remains acute. The number of big-name coaching schools is declining. Increasingly, our national teams are trained by foreign coaches. It is normal practice for foreign experts to be invited from abroad; it is used all over the world. The problem arises when the main goal becomes to win here and now, the transfer of international experience and technology to Russian coaches is not organised. In some countries, for example, the contracts offered to such invited foreign experts stipulate that the visiting foreign coach will work with local coaches and train them on top of training the athletes. I think this is a sound, systematic approach and we must introduce it where this practice is not widespread. It is used in some areas in our country but far from everywhere. Russia has 9,000 qualified sports graduates every year, and statistics show that employment is high among them, over 80%. But we must recognise that the employment market in the field of physical education and sport is not attractive at present. Demand is high only in sectors that pay well, and that does not include children’s sports schools or municipal clubs, nor even research. In essence, the sectors that work for the future and for future victories are not among the most attractive career choices. Today I would like to hear your suggestions on ways to ensure an inflow of talent, to interest influential coaches in working in their home country and training new generations of coaches. Another issue is the development of sports science. In this area, we have addressed only the priority issues of biomedical support for athletes. We should be happy that even this much has been achieved, although there is much yet to be done for Russia to reach the highest level that is required today. This programme’s implementation has been quite effective so far and it has been extended to 2015. Many athletes and coaches have suggested that we revive a network of sports health clinics in the regions. I used to be monitored and treated at one of such clinics myself. Their services could benefit not only the members of national teams, but also young athletes; most importantly, they used to employ highly qualified experts in the field of sports medicine. I believe these institutions could play a very important role. I know there has also been a suggestion to establish a national sports medicine centre. This is also a valid proposal and we could discuss and implement it. It is necessary to analyse the state of affairs in scientific research. Its results are directly related to the improvement of training methods, as well as to the development of sports technology, which is particularly important for the Paralympics. Mr Lukin [Human Rights Ombudsman and President of the Russian Paralympic Committee] and I have already talked about this and he also believes that these are self-evident things. Unfortunately, we are far behind in this area, including due to the lack of funding. But it would be wrong to rely entirely on federal funding; we should use the system of public-private partnerships to support organisations that are engaged in such research often on a voluntary basis, on their own initiative. In conclusion, I would like to touch on the issue that we raise at almost every meeting on the development of sport: active promotion of physical fitness and sport, and the role of the media in this important effort. Time passes by but we have not seen any major changes in this area. Experts estimate that more than 80% of all media materials about sports are live reports from competitions. Of course, that is what audiences want to watch. Nevertheless, there are other important themes, such as the development of mass sports, which receive very little coverage, except when we ask for it directly. Sometimes nationwide or regional competitions are organised for the best work of journalism, but an integrated system has not been created yet. There is clearly a shortage of educational programs and projects on sport. I understand that this initiative requires a lot of work and creativity. Nobody is benefited by boring programmes, neither the audience nor the channels’ ratings. Therefore, the task is to produce interesting, relevant and needed programmes. Currently the issue of launching a new 24 hours sports channel is being discussed at VGTRK broadcasting company, and there is a possibility that it will be included in the next multiplex. Perhaps Mr Dobrodeyev [CEO of National State Television and Radio Company] here can tell us about it and if not, I will ask him to report to me separately. In general, promoting sport and an active lifestyle is a priority for this Council. I suggest that we devote one of our meetings to this issue. I would also like to inform you that starting this year the Council for the Development of Physical Culture and Sport, like other advisory bodies, will work in a new format. In particular, five interagency committees and three working groups covering separate areas will be established as part of the Council. This will allow us to hold in-depth discussions and more effectively resolve issues of concern, with the active involvement of professionals, experts and public associations. That is all I wanted to say at the start. Thank you for your attention.

The President instructed the Education and Science Ministry to keep the regional education system modernisation process under its ongoing supervision. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. Our meeting today is on the state of progress of our project to modernise the general education system in the regions. The project was planned for a timeframe of 2.5 years and is nearing completion now, or at least the purely federal component is nearing completion. I remind you that this comprehensive programme was launched more than a year ago, and the project’s main priorities were fixed in presidential executive orders issued in May this year. Providing quality education and raising teachers’ qualifications and social status are our key policy priorities for the coming years. We realise that the general education system must meet our people’s demands, be affordable and open, fair, and offer equal opportunities for all. Feedback from the teachers themselves, which I will speak more about later, shows that the education professionals as a whole have reacted very positively to the programme. What matters is that the project is developing and the surveys show an increasingly positive assessment coming from teachers over the last year. The project’s success depends in large part on the effort the regions put in. We have a linkup here with our colleagues in Perm, Krasnodar, and Kurgan, and I will give them the floor during the meeting so that they can tell us how the work is going in their regions. There are plenty of good examples, but unfortunately, the opposite is also true, and we find examples of blatant inaction and a formalist approach to work. We are to raise the demands and be firmer in such cases. I expect to hear from the Education and Science Minister [Dmitry Livanov     Livanov DmitrySpecial Presidential Representative for Trade and Economic Relations with Ukraine ] a detailed report on the project’s state of progress. You will be our main speaker today, and I’d like to hear from you on all aspects of the work and how things are progressing. At the same time, I want to draw your attention to a few other matters I think are important.  First is the need to ensure the right conditions for children’s education, including measures to develop and better equip schools. I know that not all teachers and classrooms have modern equipment yet. Even in cases when the equipment has been delivered, the surveys show that one fifth of teachers have not been able to make use of it yet because of poor internet access and a lack of the necessary manuals and software. Let me say to you all here and in the regions that we need not just formal reports on budget money spent. This is the easy part. We also need real change in the quality of the education process itself. For your reference, 80 billion rubles [$2.6 billion] in federal budget money was allocated to the regions in 2011–2012. This is a considerable amount of money in the education sector. Another 40 billion rubles [$1.3 billion] has been earmarked in 2013. Regional budgets contributed a total of 8.8 billion rubles in 2011, and this total will come to 10.8 billion rubles for this year. As we always say in such cases, each ruble must be accounted for and put to effective use. Second, we agreed with the regions that one of the main criteria for evaluating the project’s effectiveness would be that teachers’ wages are in line with the average wage in each particular region. This is something we have been talking about for the second year in a row now. I note that 62 regions fulfilled this task last year, while in the rest, teachers’ wages have been raised by 30 percent or more, but have still not reached the average for the region. Right from the start, when we first discussed this matter, I agreed that it would be difficult for some regions to bring wages into line with the regional average in just a year, but almost all of the regional governors promised that within two years they would all do it. What do we see in reality though? I think the Minister will tell us more about this. According to the survey results, 61.3 percent of respondents said they had had a pay rise at the end of 2011, and in 2012, 51.6 percent said they had had a pay rise, a total of 40.5 percent said their wages are at the same level as last year, and 7.9 percent said their wages are now lower than at the end of 2011. Wages have risen faster for teachers on high and middle incomes. In other words, wages have been raised wherever it has been easiest to do so. I will not give the absolute figures right now, but there are some worrying facts about teachers’ pay, which remains very low. Average wages are rising now around the country. Wages in schools, especially teachers’ wages, should follow suit. Why do I put such stress on this? The fact of the matter is that we are getting worrying signals from some regions. Instead of continued growth, average pay for teachers has decreased. The regions at greatest risk of not meeting the set objectives are the Republics of Chechnya, Daghestan, and Ingushetia, and Vologda, Magadan, and Chelyabinsk Regions. Of course, we all know that the wage dynamic in the education sector has its own specific features. Wages cannot rise from month to month. Traditionally, bonuses are paid at the end of the year, and holiday pay is paid at the start of the summer. Wages objectively always decrease a little in July and August. What I am talking about is the average wage, which should be higher now, after the first three quarters of 2012, than it was at the end of 2011. Let me stress, however, that it is unacceptable when some regions, in order to post good statistics, pump up teachers’ pay at the end of the year only to bring it down again at the start of the following year. None of you can resort to this kind of ‘arithmetic’. Not only is this disrespectful towards our people, but it discredits the whole objective and the authorities in general. We promised that average wages for teachers would increase in line with the increase in average wages in the economy as a whole, and we must keep our word. I would like to hear from the Education and Science Minister on how supervision of the project’s key components is being carried out. Which regions are struggling to meet the set objectives? What has been done and what do you plan to do to fix this situation? Third, wage rises should be pegged to structural changes in the education system and higher professional demands on teachers themselves. It is fair that the best teachers should receive higher wages. The regions in their efforts should use the most effective methods of encouraging quality and conscientious work. Teachers’ performance should be evaluated not on the basis of what individual higher-ups think, but on criteria that are clear and transparent for the teachers and for society in general. These criteria should be set out in the professional standards. The first sets of professional standards – for maths, literature, and Russian language teachers – should be ready by March 2013, and the teachers and experts must be involved in their drafting. The Education Ministry has already received the relevant instruction, and I ask the Minister to say a few words about this too, today. Fourth, we have to seriously review the situation in teacher training. This concerns both training for students and teachers’ professional development programmes. As for the aspects I think are important here, future teachers need a good solid basic education, and so I think we should make more use of the possibilities our classical universities offer for training teachers. Education is a sector in which we must avoid inconsistent action and constant turns from one direction to another. We must explain and clearly justify all of our actions and management decisions. You all know what I am talking about. There were no chance figures in the last Government Cabinet, and the same is true now, when our current minister was previously a deputy minister and the rector of one of Moscow’s biggest universities. When people do not understand what is happening, then mistakes and glitches in the overall process start occurring, and in education lack of understanding among the public is a very serious thing. We are to be in constant and open dialogue with the public and with the professional community. This demand applies to the authorities at every level. The regions must decide clearly how many teachers their schools need and what disciplines will be taught based on real demands, and get the universities to train specialists in accordance. Teachers working in schools must have the conditions they need to be able to constantly improve their knowledge and skills and raise their qualifications. As the education modernisation project has shown in full measure, teachers have a huge desire for professional growth. Colleagues, we must ensure that the quality of education our children receive and the living standards of their teachers continue to rise. This work goes beyond the scope of what a single project can achieve and will be a long-term undertaking. Achieving these goals is the guarantee of our country’s success. I therefore particularly stress the point that once the federal financing ends the work to modernise education in the regions must continue. This is extremely important. After all, we allocated additional funding from the federal budget in order to set this process in motion. Starting from the middle of next year, the responsibility for continuing this work, including providing the funding, will be fully in the hands of the regions. I therefore ask the Education and Science Ministry to continue monitoring this project even after the additional federal funding ends. The Ministry should coordinate this process with the regions and provide them with all methodological and other such help as may be required. Reports are coming in from the regions that they are seriously lacking methodological material on carrying out education system modernisation. I ask the Education Ministry to give this its particular attention and to continue monitoring the situation with teachers’ pay, based on a common and justified approach. I therefore ask that the regional budgets’ expenditure be analysed at this stage. This is something the Finance Ministry can do. You have all the information on this. I ask you to analyse the spending planned for general education in 2013 and for the 2014–2015 period, so that the regional budgets can make the necessary adjustments in time. I propose that we return to the discussion of the education modernisation project’s results for 2012, and also look in detail at the plans for next year. I ask the Government to draft the relevant report by February. Of course, the bulk of the work will fall once more to the Education and Science Ministry. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16764, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting on modernising regional education systems', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin held a meeting on modernising regional education systems.

Wages in schools, especially teachers’ wages, should follow suit. Why do I put such stress on this? The fact of the matter is that we are getting worrying signals from some regions. Instead of continued growth, average pay for teachers has decreased. The regions at greatest risk of not meeting the set objectives are the Republics of Chechnya, Daghestan, and Ingushetia, and Vologda, Magadan, and Chelyabinsk Regions. Of course, we all know that the wage dynamic in the education sector has its own specific features. Wages cannot rise from month to month. Traditionally, bonuses are paid at the end of the year, and holiday pay is paid at the start of the summer. Wages objectively always decrease a little in July and August. What I am talking about is the average wage, which should be higher now, after the first three quarters of 2012, than it was at the end of 2011. Let me stress, however, that it is unacceptable when some regions, in order to post good statistics, pump up teachers’ pay at the end of the year only to bring it down again at the start of the following year. None of you can resort to this kind of ‘arithmetic’. Not only is this disrespectful towards our people, but it discredits the whole objective and the authorities in general. We promised that average wages for teachers would increase in line with the increase in average wages in the economy as a whole, and we must keep our word. I would like to hear from the Education and Science Minister on how supervision of the project’s key components is being carried out. Which regions are struggling to meet the set objectives? What has been done and what do you plan to do to fix this situation? Third, wage rises should be pegged to structural changes in the education system and higher professional demands on teachers themselves. It is fair that the best teachers should receive higher wages. The regions in their efforts should use the most effective methods of encouraging quality and conscientious work. Teachers’ performance should be evaluated not on the basis of what individual higher-ups think, but on criteria that are clear and transparent for the teachers and for society in general. These criteria should be set out in the professional standards. The first sets of professional standards – for maths, literature, and Russian language teachers – should be ready by March 2013, and the teachers and experts must be involved in their drafting. The Education Ministry has already received the relevant instruction, and I ask the Minister to say a few words about this too, today. Fourth, we have to seriously review the situation in teacher training. This concerns both training for students and teachers’ professional development programmes. As for the aspects I think are important here, future teachers need a good solid basic education, and so I think we should make more use of the possibilities our classical universities offer for training teachers. Education is a sector in which we must avoid inconsistent action and constant turns from one direction to another. We must explain and clearly justify all of our actions and management decisions. You all know what I am talking about. There were no chance figures in the last Government Cabinet, and the same is true now, when our current minister was previously a deputy minister and the rector of one of Moscow’s biggest universities. When people do not understand what is happening, then mistakes and glitches in the overall process start occurring, and in education lack of understanding among the public is a very serious thing. We are to be in constant and open dialogue with the public and with the professional community. This demand applies to the authorities at every level. The regions must decide clearly how many teachers their schools need and what disciplines will be taught based on real demands, and get the universities to train specialists in accordance. Teachers working in schools must have the conditions they need to be able to constantly improve their knowledge and skills and raise their qualifications. As the education modernisation project has shown in full measure, teachers have a huge desire for professional growth. Colleagues, we must ensure that the quality of education our children receive and the living standards of their teachers continue to rise. This work goes beyond the scope of what a single project can achieve and will be a long-term undertaking. Achieving these goals is the guarantee of our country’s success. I therefore particularly stress the point that once the federal financing ends the work to modernise education in the regions must continue. This is extremely important. After all, we allocated additional funding from the federal budget in order to set this process in motion. Starting from the middle of next year, the responsibility for continuing this work, including providing the funding, will be fully in the hands of the regions. I therefore ask the Education and Science Ministry to continue monitoring this project even after the additional federal funding ends. The Ministry should coordinate this process with the regions and provide them with all methodological and other such help as may be required. Reports are coming in from the regions that they are seriously lacking methodological material on carrying out education system modernisation. I ask the Education Ministry to give this its particular attention and to continue monitoring the situation with teachers’ pay, based on a common and justified approach. I therefore ask that the regional budgets’ expenditure be analysed at this stage. This is something the Finance Ministry can do. You have all the information on this. I ask you to analyse the spending planned for general education in 2013 and for the 2014–2015 period, so that the regional budgets can make the necessary adjustments in time. I propose that we return to the discussion of the education modernisation project’s results for 2012, and also look in detail at the plans for next year. I ask the Government to draft the relevant report by February. Of course, the bulk of the work will fall once more to the Education and Science Ministry. <…>', 'wordlist': ['good', 'afternoon', ',', 'colleague', '.', ' ', 'our', 'meeting', 'today', 'be', 'on',

Since it is located in Russia and is the result of our joint efforts, I suggest we call it the Russian Jewish Museum of Tolerance, which would be more accurate. I have vivid memories of my visit to Yad Vashem [the Holocaust Memorial] in Jerusalem. It left a truly lasting impression, a very strong impression. The idea behind your museum is similar – we have discussed recreating such a project here in Russia. People of many nationalities suffered during World War II in the former Soviet Union and Russia, and I remember when we talked about it, your idea was to create a museum and a memorial centre to the Russian and Soviet Jews killed by the Nazis, but also to keep alive the memory of all the peoples in the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation who fell victim to Nazism. I am very pleased that this event coincides with the visit of the Israeli President to Russia, because he will have an opportunity to see what we have achieved together. It gives me great pleasure to offer my congratulations on this momentous occasion. Chief Rabbi of Russia Berl Lazar: Thank you very much and thank you for all your help. Indeed, I think that the significance of this event for the President of Israel will go far beyond the opening of the museum. This is a confirmation of a new era in the life of Russian Jews, and this museum is one of its manifestations. The story the museum will tell will not be limited to the war years and the most important events and the tragedy of the Jewish people, but we also wanted to tell the story of modern Jews. How do Jews live in Russia today? Their lives are comfortable for the first time in many years, and largely this is thanks to you, as well as the efforts of all peoples of Russia, who truly live and work together today for the nation’s prosperity. I would like to add that the museum’s most valuable aspect for us is the fact that it is a Centre of Tolerance, because we are aware that this is a major challenge facing Russia and it must be addressed. There is far less anti-Semitism in Russia today than in the past, and perhaps our experience can also be useful to others. We can see that such issues can be resolved with the active involvement of the state. We want life to become easier for everyone and we hope that this centre will give a real impetus to a new vision of how we can live together and help each other. Vladimir Putin: That’s right. You said a very important thing, that there is less anti-Semitism in Russia today. Of course, it means that some anti-Semitism remains. It certainly doesn’t exist at the state level but it can still be encountered in everyday life. For us, for such a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country as Russia, it is vitally important (as I have said many times) to ensure that representatives of every, even the smallest nation, the smallest ethnic group feel and perceive Russia as their homeland. This is possible only when every person, regardless of religion or ethnicity, feels completely comfortable and secure in the knowledge that his or her rights are protected by society and the legal system. This is essential, and the new museum, which will open tomorrow, will contribute to the attainment of this goal. There is one more point I would like to highlight. The opening of this museum is to a certain extent our response to Israel and the Israeli Government for the monument they opened to the Red Army and the sacrifices made by our country for the good of the Fatherland and for victory over Nazism in World War II. I think that this is also an essential element that will serve to strengthen relations between our nations at the state level. President of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia Alexander Boroda: Mr President, I would like to add a few words about the museum that we are going to open tomorrow. It is an unusual museum, built with the use of cutting edge technology and the latest advances in science. There is a separate pavilion with video materials and interactive panels. We believe it will attract many young people, children and families, who will visit the museum and see these technologies at work. This is the first such a museum in Russia and the world. The people who worked on creating it say that nothing like that was ever made before, that there is no such precedent. At the core of the exposition at the Centre of Tolerance, which will open tomorrow, are also videos and interactive panels, and these materials are used to teach children and young people respect for the elderly, the understanding of problems faced by the disabled, as well as interethnic, religious and racial tolerance in the form that they can relate to. We hope that this centre becomes firmly established as a popular venue among children, and that Moscow Education Department includes visits to the centre in its programmes. Then we will see concrete results and perhaps this experience can be replicated in other cities. We want the centre to train education professionals to teach a wide range of aspects of tolerance. Vladimir Putin: This is a very good model. I remember when I first visited the newly opened synagogue (this was about eight years ago), I saw how in addition to the religious part, it also had a gym and a restaurant – it became a genuine cultural and religious centre. Now the Russian Orthodox Church is about to open a similar centre. I hope very much that the other traditional religions in our country will follow this example because these are excellent leisure centres for the whole family. People can come with their children and spend a whole day there: they can do sports, visit the temple, the library and so on. This is a very good example that is already being copied. I hope that the museum that will open tomorrow will also be replicated across the country. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16768, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting with Chief Rabbi of Russia Berl Lazar and President of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia Alexander Boroda', 'teaser': 'Mr Lazar and Mr Boroda briefed Vladimir Putin on the upcoming opening of the Russian Jewish Museum of Tolerance in Moscow.', 'tags': ['Religion'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, friends, I know that you have completed your work on the establishment of the Jewish Museum of Tolerance and Memorial Centre. Since it is located in Russia and is the result of our joint efforts, I suggest we call it the Russian Jewish Museum of Tolerance, which would be more accurate. I have vivid memories of my visit to Yad Vashem [the Holocaust Memorial] in Jerusalem. It left a truly lasting impression, a very strong impression. The idea behind your museum is similar – we have discussed recreating such a project here in Russia. People of many nationalities suffered during World War II in the former Soviet Union and Russia, and I remember when we talked about it, your idea was to create a museum and a memorial centre to the Russian and Soviet Jews killed by the Nazis, but also to keep alive the memory of all the peoples in the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation who fell victim to Nazism. I am very pleased that this event coincides with the visit of the Israeli President to Russia, because he will have an opportunity to see what we have achieved together. It gives me great pleasure to offer my congratulations on this momentous occasion. That’s right. You said a very important thing, that there is less anti-Semitism in Russia today.

We attended the unveiling of a memorial in honour of the Red Army’s victory in World War II. Today another joint project was brought to life in Moscow: the opening of the Russian Jewish Museum of Tolerance. I am confident that it will make a contribution to countering xenophobia, nationalism and racial prejudice, and will play a major part in the preservation of historical memory and strengthening accord among nations. During out talks, we covered virtually all issues on the bilateral agenda. Russian-Israeli relations are on the rise and we are satisfied with their friendly character. Our bilateral trade is modest in absolute terms, but one positive factor is that we have overcome the decline in mutual trade. We see good prospects in a number of areas of cooperation, including energy, agriculture, high technology and nanotechnology, space exploration and transport infrastructure. Russian specialists have been working since February 2012 on building tunnels for the high-speed railway line from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. We have also talked about various opportunities for cooperation in the social sphere. In addition, we have discussed key international issues, including the situation in the Middle East, in Syria, and Iran's nuclear programme. We have a common understanding of the need to resolve long-standing conflicts, especially the Arab-Israeli conflict. The only way to settlement is through dialogue and Russia calls on the parties to return to the negotiating table. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that Russia highly values its friendly relations with Israel. I am grateful to Mr President and all our Israeli colleagues who took part in today’s negotiations for the informative and useful conversation. I would also like to congratulate the President of Israel on being awarded the title of Honorary Professor of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Mr President, this title is in recognition of your contribution to strengthening humanitarian, scientific and educational ties between our countries. President of Israel Shimon Peres     Peres Shimon  (translated from Russian): Thank you very much. Mr President, thank you for inviting me to take part in this historic event – this museum’s opening. Let me start by saying that this museum is unique from the architectural point of view. It was a very brave decision to build a museum that unites two such seemingly incompatible things as ancient history and bold modern architecture. There is no other museum in the world that retells the development over history of the relations between two peoples: a big people – the Russian people, and a small people – the Jewish people. I am amazed at how much effort and energy have gone into this project. This is a unique museum. I thank you from all my heart for your contribution to its founding. I think too, that this museum is a declaration of tolerance and evidence of the thousand-year history between Russia and the Jews, or, more precisely, of the thousand years over which the Russian people has welcomed the Jews to Russia. It is true that our common history has also known shadows and difficult times, but it remains nonetheless a unique history. I have deep respect for the Russian people. This is a great people, and when I say ‘great’, I am referring not to Russia’s vast size, but to your people’s greatness of soul. I believe that the entire world is deeply indebted to the Russian people for their superhuman efforts in destroying the Nazi threat. Thirty million Soviet citizens died in that war. They saved the world from disaster. I want to pay tribute to their memory and to the Soviet and Russian peoples for their heroism. The Russian people fought against the Nazis’ massive war machine, not retreating until they had reached the gates of Berlin and liberated the whole world from this most terrible danger that threatened all of humanity.  This was liberation for the world, for humanity, and for my people. The Nazis tried to wipe out my people. They killed 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children. I thank you as a citizen of the world, and I thank you as a Jew. This victory enabled us to live again and become an independent people once more, a people capable of defending itself, but never forgetting that our greatest goal is peace.  Russia has played a very important part in history, and any objective observer can see that Russia, and you in particular, Mr President, shoulder the responsibility for ensuring that such a war never again happens in our world. This is a very serious responsibility and not simply a question of some political event that will not repeat itself again. We have the problem of Iran today, which you mentioned earlier. Those who deny the Holocaust can indirectly help to create a new one. During your visit to Israel you said that Israel’s security is important for Russia, and that Russia will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. Neither we nor you hate Iran, but we and you both want to live in a world without fear, threats, and annihilation. There is also the very tense situation in Syria. The Syrians are not our enemies, but what is happening now in Syria is a danger for the Syrian people and the entire Middle East. It is hard to see clearly right now who will come to power in Syria. The one thing that is clear is that blood is being spilt there and extremist forces are starting to take power. Several shells launched from Syria landed on Israeli territory today. For many years we have had quiet on the border with Syria, and we would like this to continue. I believe that Russia has an important role and that you do too, Mr President. You can stop the bloodshed in Syria and bring peace and security to the region, not only to Syria itself, but to the Middle East as a whole. As for Israel, we are obliged to defend ourselves.

He is a military man through and through, someone who has spent his career in the armed forces and is respected there, and he has a wealth of experience at General Staff itself as well as in the field. He has taken part in military operations too, of course. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Gerasimov, which years were you First Deputy Chief of the General Staff? Valery Gerasimov: From 2010 to 2012. Vladimir Putin: You worked two years in the post? Valery Gerasimov: Eighteen months. Vladimir Putin: You are an experienced person. We will have more opportunities to talk, to discuss the issues facing the Armed Forces today, the issues facing the army, navy, and air force. Of course, one of the top priorities is re-equipping the Armed Forces, but this is not our only task. There is also work to do on improving the Armed Forces’ structure and command. I know you from earlier positions, and I think the Minister has chosen a good candidate. I hope that you will work with maximum effort and effectiveness. Valery Gerasimov: Commander in Chief, I thank you for your confidence in me. I think the General Staff’s efforts should focus entirely on the main goal of guaranteeing that our Armed Forces are combat ready and able to carry out all missions given them. I will do all in my power to achieve this goal.  Vladimir Putin: The General Staff has a big say in deciding what kinds of arms we supply to the different Armed Forces branches and troops. We do have a problem to settle, and it is something that can be taken care of in routine fashion, but the objective of course is to keep problems to a minimum. The problem is that of late we have often run up against the Defence Ministry changing the demands it places on the defence industry. This is natural of course, because changing circumstances in life constantly require us to make adjustments. Science and technology in this sector develop fast, and new means of warfare are emerging all the time. Of course we need to make the latest advances our reference, but at the same time, a degree of stability is also essential.

The Ministry of Culture was given a number of specific instructions, including to establish five cultural development centres, increase electronic libraries’ stocks, make the best films and performances freely accessible online, and develop the Kultura internet portal.  Work is now fully underway in all of these areas and I can report to you on the situation with each of them. I can even say that in some areas, some of the work has been completed already before the funding has been made available. We optimised the system in such a way that we have now completed the work on setting up virtual museums. They are online now and everyone can take part in the virtual visits they offer. We are actively making films and performances available online. This work is going ahead according to schedule. We want to do some creative building on the kultura.rf [culture.ru] portal and establish a similar portal in the tourism sector, primarily for domestic tourism, and also a Russian history portal, all the more so as this year is the Year of History in our country. The biggest task you set the Ministry is to raise wages in the sector. Following your instruction, we are in the process of optimising the culture sector establishments, taking into account the additional funding that you have decided to allocate for wages next year. Let me stress that this optimisation is not about layoffs, but is simply a process of improving financial relations and taking a more thorough approach to internal accounting in culture establishments, that is, the work carried out by the directors of our museums, theatres, circuses and so on. From the start of next year, we will be able to use the additional federal funding, and we expect to raise the wages of people working in federal cultural establishments by 30–33 percent. I am talking here not of the bosses, but of the staff – the research staff, museum staff, and archival personnel. If these establishments’ heads show enough initiative in the optimisation effort this pay rise will be more substantial.  Over the month following your decision, I travelled to many regions and spoke with the regional heads. I can report to you that the trend you have set for raising wages in the sector has been taken up practically everywhere, and the regions are in the process of finding the reserves to fund this now. I am sure that there will not be a single region that is not giving your initiative its support. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good. Of course, you need to pay attention to the regional cultural establishments too, not just the federal ones. Vladimir Medinsky: This is the top priority. Vladimir Putin: Yes, because, as you know, there are many such establishments, and many of them are both cultural and educational – various creative schools, schools of art, music schools. You need to work in this area too, together with the Education Ministry and your colleagues in the regions.  <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16779, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Working meeting with Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky', 'teaser': 'Mr Medinsky briefed Vladimir Putin on the Ministry’s current activities, in particular, measures taken to raise wages in the culture sector.', 'tags': ['Culture', 'School'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good.

This year alone, five Interior Ministry employees were awarded the Hero of Russia Star, three of them posthumously. Ninety-seven of our comrades were killed this year, and several hundred were injured while on duty. All fields in which you work are important for Russian society. As I already said, they include the fight against crime, extremism and terrorism. A very important aspect of your work concerns protecting the legitimate rights of economic actors. Naturally, failures and betrayals are unavoidable in such vast, enormous, great work. That much is clear. But it is also clear that you, the Ministry’s leaders, should do everything possible to eventually reduce the number of such instances to zero. I know that all of you are experienced and have worked a great deal and well in a wide range of fields, while many of you began their service in some of the lowest positions in the Interior Ministry and worked their way up. I wish you every success. Many here hold a new position as leaders in one of our country’s largest governmental agencies. Once again I would like to congratulate you on today’s holiday.

On behalf of the Interior Ministry staff I would like to thank our country’s leaders for the attention and support that we really, truly feel. We now have the necessary legal framework; the social protection of our employees has improved, as have the general material-technical supply within our Ministry. And we really are aware of the responsibility that rests on our shoulders: the responsibility for ensuring public safety and security of our citizens. And on behalf of the entire Interior Ministry personnel I want to assure you, as the President of our country, that we will make every effort to accomplish the tasks that face us. Vladimir Putin: Indeed, just recently a number of important decisions to consolidate the legal framework governing your activity, to improve the legal and organisational structure, and to address a number of pressing social issues have been taken. On average, wages have increased 1.5-fold and have doubled for some categories of staff, while pensions for Ministry veterans have also increased. Ongoing reforms, which have been talked about so much, are not over yet, and we still need to think about improving legal structures. Just as we cannot assume that all social problems have been solved. I know about housing problems and, together with the Ministry’s leadership, the Government, and presidential agencies, we will think about them. We will think about what to do additionally so that the Ministry’s personnel and their families feel that their problems are not being ignored and remain our concern. That the government is thinking about this and will resolve these problems. That’s what we are going to do. Once again, congratulations on your holiday!

The latest rotation in membership took place based on the results of public discussions and internet voting, in which more than 100,000 people took part. In accordance with the President’s Executive Order, the Council has 62 members, of which 39 are new members. * * * Excerpts from transcript of Council for Civil Society and Human Rights meeting President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. This is the Council’s first meeting since the membership was renewed. Many of you I already know, while for others it will be the first time that we are working together. As you know, broad discussions and internet voting on the Council’s members took place. I remind you that more than 100,000 people took part in the voting and there were more than 400,000 visits (430,000, I think) to the sites where people could make their vote. Choosing the Council’s members drew a lot of public interest. This is why Mr Fedotov [Presidential Adviser and Chairman of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov] and I decided to increase the number of members so as to include all of those who received the most votes, given that people clearly want to see you have a place on this presidential advisory body. This in turn raises questions about the Council’s management. With this many members, we have to organise efforts in such a way as to ensure that not only does it help me in my work, but that we can have an impact together on the performance of the country’s executive bodies and law enforcement agencies in general. There are several proposals in this respect. One proposal is to establish a presidium, the membership of which will rotate on a regular basis, or to set up specific working groups for the areas of activity of greatest interest to particular Council members. The important thing in all of this is to ensure that we have direct contact of course, and that this direct contact helps us to carry out the Council’s tasks and objectives. As far as the tasks are concerned, there is nothing really new here, I think. I hope very much that our work will continue what has already been accomplished over these last years. We must certainly pay attention to all aspects of our life: political issues, the way our society and state are organised, and social issues. No doubt, people expect that those professionally involved in human rights will be able to give them substantial support, especially at moments when there are breakdowns in the state mechanisms. I look upon our cooperation as a form of direct feedback from Russian society, reaching right to the top level of power, and this enables us to work together on improving our instruments of government and establishing the conditions that will let us solve our country’s problems in our citizens’ interests above all. I will not make a long speech and want to give the floor now to Mr Fedotov. After that, we will discuss all of the issues that you think most important and fitting to raise at this first meeting. <…> You mentioned that we established the Council in 2004. Let me remind you of the circumstances of that time. The situation was very complicated back then. The country had been going through what was in effect a state of civil war, albeit not of an acute form, but nonetheless a very painful and bloody armed conflict. Let me be frank here, as those working at that time no doubt remember, my view often did not coincide with that of the Council members on a number of the key issues concerning our country’s functioning at that time. Today’s situation is vastly, if not totally, different, although big problems still remain as we can see from the flare-ups in terrorist activity, acts of terrorism, organised crime and so on. But overall, there has been substantial change, fundamental change, I would say. I cannot assert that everything I thought right back then did indeed turn out to be so, but nor can I say that everything the Council members asked or demanded of me was justified. I remember very clearly my discussions with your colleagues from Europe back then. There were many such discussions, but I remember particularly clearly one discussion when a woman who was very pleasant in all respects – and I am not being ironic here – said that she took a very critical view of what we (Russia and myself) were doing in the Caucasus. She said we were using very harsh methods that are unacceptable in today’s world. I asked her, ‘Look at what they’re doing there. What methods should we use to stop them in your view?’ She said, ‘We condemn their actions too, but we criticise you because this is a part of your territory and you are failing to ensure order there’. I asked her, ‘How can we restore order if we do not use the methods you condemn?’ ‘I don’t know’, she replied. Why do I bring this up again now? People might criticise a government for its actions, and this criticism might even be fair and justified, but when no one knows what to do there has to be someone willing to take on the responsibility. Do not be offended at me if our views do not always coincide, and I in turn will do everything I can not to take offence at anything I hear from you. But I ask you, please, to do the same for me. Our work together must be direct, open and honest. Mr Fedotov spoke just before about direct forms of democracy, and said that the way the Council members are chosen is not perhaps the best method: experts should choose experts, but then administrators should choose administrators and so on. It’s a debatable idea. There is no disputing however, that we should develop forms of direct democracy. One possible step in this respect is the idea that 100,000 identifiable signatures collected via the internet on a specific proposal would be enough to have it examined in parliament. Of course, not all issues raised in this way would necessarily concern federal-level matters. They could be regional or municipal issues too, and so we would need to decide the procedures for working with these kinds of proposals. <…> (On migration) This is a sensitive, delicate and complex issue. I have already stated my position in the past but can do so again now. Most of the migration to Russia is labour migration, and we need to differentiate between these migrants and our compatriots returning to their homeland. We know that the Soviet Union’s collapse left 25 million ethnic Russians or those who consider their roots to be in Russia outside the Russian Federation borders. They found themselves beyond our borders not of their own free will, and it is our duty to help those of them who wish to do so, without imposing anything on anyone, to return to Russia. Labour migrants are another matter. It is not by chance that you, someone from the construction sector, should have raised this issue. We know that many migrants work in this particular sector. Indeed, foreign labour plays a big part in developing this sector and a number of other sectors in our economy. The only thing is we need to ensure that this process does not undermine our country’s own labour market. That is the first consideration.  Second, we need to settle matters concerning the rights and lawful interests of our citizens living in areas with a large inflow of migrants. Third – not in terms of importance, but simply in sequence of course – is the need to protect the rights and interests of the migrants themselves, and this is also something we must not forget. A fourth issue to consider is that millions of people from the former Soviet republics who come to work in Russia are not only earning money here and sending it back home to support their families, but are also maintaining ties with Russia and keeping up the interest in Russia. For all the problems that accompany this migration influx, these people are continuing the interest in our culture and our language, and this is one of the factors helping to preserve our common economic and humanitarian space. In this sense migration plays a positive part. At the same time, the migration process is also very complicated. We certainly do need to address the problems it creates, but we must do so very carefully.  <…> (On the law regulating the activities of NGOs acting as foreign agents) My position was that everything not directly related to politics should be excluded [from this law]. The only purpose of this law after all was to ensure that foreign organisations representing outside interests, not those of the Russian state, would not intervene in our domestic affairs. This is something that no self-respecting country can accept. I do not think there is anything in this law that contradicts democratic development in our country. But the law should not apply to activities not related to politics. Let’s take another look at it. I have already discussed this matter with Mr Fedotov. We could meet in a broader format and have an open discussion on the matter. We do not have any issues that are not open for discussion. After all, everything we do, we do with the sole objective of making our country stronger and more stable and effective. But our country cannot become stronger and more stable by relying on the powers of law enforcement and security agencies alone. It will be stronger if our society is more united, effective and responsible, and if we establish good contact between society, citizens, and the state authorities. In this respect I agree completely with you that human rights activists, who bring our citizens’ problems to the attention of society, play a very important part in helping us to reach our national objective. Thank you very much for the work together. I am sorry that not everyone had the chance to speak. We have agreed not to take offense at each other. The meeting is over then.

            "{'date': '2012-11-13T11:45:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': 'Following the meeting, the President instructed the Government to examine the entire range of issues connected to the organisation of major housing repairs and their financing. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good evening, colleagues, Today we will begin a series of regular meetings on improving housing and the quality of housing and utilities services. These meetings will be attended not only by Government members, but also by representatives of the legislature and regional authorities, as well as experts, who are also present here today. All of us realise that the housing issue was very acute in Russia before October 1917 and during the entire Soviet period, and continues to remain so today. As I have repeatedly said, and many of those present agreed with me, we have a historic opportunity to address this issue and if not resolve it completely – I don’t know of any major country that has resolved the housing issue completely – but we have a historic opportunity to minimise its severity and to reduce it to the minimum. In fact, this is our chance to introduce radical changes in the sector. The matters we will discuss have vital importance for everyone. Opinion polls show that utilities prices are the most sensitive topic for 44% of Russians, whereas 26% are concerned about the unavailability and high cost of housing, and 16% about the state of housing and utilities infrastructure. There are regions where over 60% and even 70% of local residents consider these problems to be the most acute and urgent – there are such regions in the Russian Federation. This once again confirms that addressing housing and utilities issues and putting the sector in order should be a priority for the authorities at all levels. You know that the strategic objectives in this area were identified in the Executive Order on measures to provide affordable and comfortable housing to the people and to improve the quality of housing and utilities services. Our first priority is the availability of housing: by 2020, 60% of families who want to improve their living conditions should have the opportunity to do so. Our aim must be a significant reduction in the cost of housing per square metre by 2018. How can this be achieved? By increasing the construction of economy class housing. In addition, the Government has been instructed to take measures to improve the quality of housing and utilities services and to eliminate dilapidated housing. Today housing construction shows faster growth compared to other sectors of the economy. In 2009–2011, 180.3 million square metres of housing were commissioned, and 34.6 million square metres in the first nine months of 2012. This is a growth of 2.7% against the same period last year. We have launched state programmes to provide social support to special categories of people and the state must fulfil the commitments it has undertaken in this sphere. Beginning in 2011, additional assistance has been provided to over 25,000 young families, which have received social benefits amounting to 15 billion rubles [$500 million] in total. Over the past four years 210,000 World War II veterans have received new housing and fewer than 10% of the veterans registered for this benefit after March 1, 2005 are still to receive it. Military personnel and police officers who are subject to discharge from service have been issued housing certificates in the amount of 21 billion rubles in the first nine months of this year alone. I will not enumerate everything that has been achieved. Much has been done, and we talk about it often, but still more work lies ahead. Our past experience clearly showed that we cannot resolve the numerous problems that have accumulated in this area using isolated measures. What we need is a comprehensive approach. I will outline the main issues that must be addressed. First, the major repairs of the housing stock. When did the active housing construction campaign begin in our country? In the 1960s, then it continued into the mid-1980s; basically the construction went on until the early 1990s, more or less, but major repairs were not tackled properly at any point in that period. Second, the management of apartment buildings. We are faced with growing number of abuse cases in this area and we must admit that many of the relevant regulations were adopted in the past decade. They did not improve the situation, but only confused it further and experts believe that honest activities in this sector are impossible a priory, which is why honest businesspeople avoid it altogether. Third, tariff setting in housing and utilities and the link between the prices and the quality of services provided. Fourth, investment attractiveness of the housing and utilities sector and the development of effective economic models to attract private investment and loans. Fifth, the development of competition in the construction sector and the removal of administrative restrictions and barriers. This also applies to property rights issues, including land. We have already talked about this several times in the recent years. This group of issues includes obtaining building permits, getting connected to electricity, water, gas, and so on and so forth. Sixth, defining the role of the state, as well as self-regulatory organisations in construction and housing and utilities, overseeing safety and quality control issues. Finally, the seventh, the development of the rental market, including social rent subsidised by the state. All the issues outlined above will be the subjects of special discussions at our future meetings. But most importantly, ladies and gentlemen, one point I want to make clear right at the beginning of our meetings on this highly sensitive issue: we need a professional, realistic analysis, we must develop solutions in this area, adopt them and make sure they are enforced in practice. This is the only way to move things forward. Under no circumstances must our meetings become simply an exchange of views on a given topic, even if the issue is very important. These meetings must result in concrete solutions in this area. Today we will focus on major housing repairs. I have already said this but I want to reiterate: according to Rosstat statistics agency, in 2011, more than half a million blocks of flats were 30% to 65% worn out. This is more than half of all apartment buildings, which are home for 45 million people. This problem has been accumulating for a long time, as I said earlier. These issues partly began to be addressed last year, including through the tools available to the Housing and Utilities Development Fund. But the scale of the necessary repairs is not commensurate with the financing available to the Fund. During the period from 2008 to 2012, nearly 135,000 buildings with a total area of over 400 million square metres were partially repaired through the Fund’s programmes. That is not a bad result. It amounts to 30% of the total area in need of repairs. As a result, housing was improved for 17.3 million people. On the whole, the Fund is coping with its tasks, but it is clear that we must look for additional tools and resources to address this problem. First of all it is necessary to conduct a complete inventory of the housing stock and then establish a system of regular monitoring, especially with regard to apartment buildings. We must have a clear picture of the situation in the entire country and in separate regions and municipalities, so that we have a clear understanding of the financial resources required for major repairs. We have a new draft law that stipulates the use of property owners’ resources for repairs of apartment buildings. At first glance, this seems to be the right approach because the owners are usually responsible for the safety and maintenance of their property, and this is standard practice in many countries, but here we have a special attitude towards housing as a subject of ownership. As a result of the privatisation, over 80% of the housing stock is privately owned. However, opinion polls show that 50% of Russians believe that the state must bear full responsibility for major housing repairs. In general, I don’t think it would be right to shift this responsibility over to the residents. In fact, they could never cope with this task. After all, when property is transferred to a new owner, it must be in good condition, and if it is not delivered in good condition its maintenance cannot be dumped on the new owners. People could get involved in this process, but the question is to what extent, how and where, and this is a very delicate question. It is difficult to explain to people why utilities prices are growing, often with poor quality of the services, yet they still have to pay extra for housing repairs. So today we must conduct a comprehensive, detailed and thorough analysis of all the proposals. They are already being examined by experts and discussed by government agencies and State Duma committees. Moreover, some regions have already gained experience in this area, they have started to implement their own programmes, and as a result they adopt balanced, effective and fair solutions. We must summarise these practices, analyse them and implement them widely. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16795, 'place': 'The Kremlin, Moscow', 'title': 'Meeting on improving housing and utilities services', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin opened a series of meetings on improving the quality of housing and utilities services.

All of us realise that the housing issue was very acute in Russia before October 1917 and during the entire Soviet period, and continues to remain so today. As I have repeatedly said, and many of those present agreed with me, we have a historic opportunity to address this issue and if not resolve it completely – I don’t know of any major country that has resolved the housing issue completely – but we have a historic opportunity to minimise its severity and to reduce it to the minimum. In fact, this is our chance to introduce radical changes in the sector. The matters we will discuss have vital importance for everyone. Opinion polls show that utilities prices are the most sensitive topic for 44% of Russians, whereas 26% are concerned about the unavailability and high cost of housing, and 16% about the state of housing and utilities infrastructure. There are regions where over 60% and even 70% of local residents consider these problems to be the most acute and urgent – there are such regions in the Russian Federation. This once again confirms that addressing housing and utilities issues and putting the sector in order should be a priority for the authorities at all levels. You know that the strategic objectives in this area were identified in the Executive Order on measures to provide affordable and comfortable housing to the people and to improve the quality of housing and utilities services. Our first priority is the availability of housing: by 2020, 60% of families who want to improve their living conditions should have the opportunity to do so. Our aim must be a significant reduction in the cost of housing per square metre by 2018. How can this be achieved? By increasing the construction of economy class housing. In addition, the Government has been instructed to take measures to improve the quality of housing and utilities services and to eliminate dilapidated housing. Today housing construction shows faster growth compared to other sectors of the economy. In 2009–2011, 180.3 million square metres of housing were commissioned, and 34.6 million square metres in the first nine months of 2012. This is a growth of 2.7% against the same period last year. We have launched state programmes to provide social support to special categories of people and the state must fulfil the commitments it has undertaken in this sphere. Beginning in 2011, additional assistance has been provided to over 25,000 young families, which have received social benefits amounting to 15 billion rubles [$500 million] in total. Over the past four years 210,000 World War II veterans have received new housing and fewer than 10% of the veterans registered for this benefit after March 1, 2005 are still to receive it. Military personnel and police officers who are subject to discharge from service have been issued housing certificates in the amount of 21 billion rubles in the first nine months of this year alone. I will not enumerate everything that has been achieved. Much has been done, and we talk about it often, but still more work lies ahead. Our past experience clearly showed that we cannot resolve the numerous problems that have accumulated in this area using isolated measures. What we need is a comprehensive approach. I will outline the main issues that must be addressed. First, the major repairs of the housing stock. When did the active housing construction campaign begin in our country? In the 1960s, then it continued into the mid-1980s; basically the construction went on until the early 1990s, more or less, but major repairs were not tackled properly at any point in that period. Second, the management of apartment buildings. We are faced with growing number of abuse cases in this area and we must admit that many of the relevant regulations were adopted in the past decade. They did not improve the situation, but only confused it further and experts believe that honest activities in this sector are impossible a priory, which is why honest businesspeople avoid it altogether. Third, tariff setting in housing and utilities and the link between the prices and the quality of services provided. Fourth, investment attractiveness of the housing and utilities sector and the development of effective economic models to attract private investment and loans. Fifth, the development of competition in the construction sector and the removal of administrative restrictions and barriers. This also applies to property rights issues, including land. We have already talked about this several times in the recent years. This group of issues includes obtaining building permits, getting connected to electricity, water, gas, and so on and so forth. Sixth, defining the role of the state, as well as self-regulatory organisations in construction and housing and utilities, overseeing safety and quality control issues. Finally, the seventh, the development of the rental market, including social rent subsidised by the state. All the issues outlined above will be the subjects of special discussions at our future meetings. But most importantly, ladies and gentlemen, one point I want to make clear right at the beginning of our meetings on this highly sensitive issue: we need a professional, realistic analysis, we must develop solutions in this area, adopt them and make sure they are enforced in practice. This is the only way to move things forward. Under no circumstances must our meetings become simply an exchange of views on a given topic, even if the issue is very important. These meetings must result in concrete solutions in this area. Today we will focus on major housing repairs. I have already said this but I want to reiterate: according to Rosstat statistics agency, in 2011, more than half a million blocks of flats were 30% to 65% worn out. This is more than half of all apartment buildings, which are home for 45 million people. This problem has been accumulating for a long time, as I said earlier. These issues partly began to be addressed last year, including through the tools available to the Housing and Utilities Development Fund. But the scale of the necessary repairs is not commensurate with the financing available to the Fund. During the period from 2008 to 2012, nearly 135,000 buildings with a total area of over 400 million square metres were partially repaired through the Fund’s programmes. That is not a bad result. It amounts to 30% of the total area in need of repairs. As a result, housing was improved for 17.3 million people. On the whole, the Fund is coping with its tasks, but it is clear that we must look for additional tools and resources to address this problem. First of all it is necessary to conduct a complete inventory of the housing stock and then establish a system of regular monitoring, especially with regard to apartment buildings. We must have a clear picture of the situation in the entire country and in separate regions and municipalities, so that we have a clear understanding of the financial resources required for major repairs. We have a new draft law that stipulates the use of property owners’ resources for repairs of apartment buildings. At first glance, this seems to be the right approach because the owners are usually responsible for the safety and maintenance of their property, and this is standard practice in many countries, but here we have a special attitude towards housing as a subject of ownership. As a result of the privatisation, over 80% of the housing stock is privately owned. However, opinion polls show that 50% of Russians believe that the state must bear full responsibility for major housing repairs. In general, I don’t think it would be right to shift this responsibility over to the residents. In fact, they could never cope with this task. After all, when property is transferred to a new owner, it must be in good condition, and if it is not delivered in good condition its maintenance cannot be dumped on the new owners. People could get involved in this process, but the question is to what extent, how and where, and this is a very delicate question. It is difficult to explain to people why utilities prices are growing, often with poor quality of the services, yet they still have to pay extra for housing repairs. So today we must conduct a comprehensive, detailed and thorough analysis of all the proposals. They are already being examined by experts and discussed by government agencies and State Duma committees. Moreover, some regions have already gained experience in this area, they have started to implement their own programmes, and as a result they adopt balanced, effective and fair solutions. We must summarise these practices, analyse them and implement them widely. <…>', 'wordlist': ['good', 'evening', ',', 'colleague', ',', 'today', 'we', 'will', 'begin', 'a', 'series', 'of', 'regular',

The Government has been instructed to draft and approve a new formula for calculating pensions in the first half of 2013. Mr Putin also gave the Government until the end of this year to settle mechanisms for using the money collected in the Pension Fund for developing the economy, in particular for carrying out long-term infrastructure projects.  * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, We are here to discuss an issue of great importance for our economy and social sector. There has been much discussion on pension system development of late. This issue has been the subject of much debate in the Government, the State Duma, and the expert community. Let me remind you that we introduced a defined contribution (DC) pension system in 2002. Overall, this system has not only demonstrated that it works but that it has potential for development too. At the same time however, given the difficulties the global economy is currently experiencing, we and many of our colleagues have been asking ourselves just how effective this system will be and to what extent it will be able to guarantee the pension system’s overall stability and – particularly important – the pension security of all groups of citizens regardless of their income. We therefore had the idea of taking some additional steps to develop the DC pension system. I will not go into all the details right now, but it became evident during the discussions that adopting the law on developing the DC pension system is directly linked – and I cannot but agree with the experts here – with the adoption of a new formula for calculating pension benefits. Unfortunately, this new formula is not ready yet, and nor are a few other regulations. At the same time, the Government has drafted and balanced the country’s budget and those of the social funds, including the Pension Fund. This thus raises a number of questions. Should we start making changes midway to what has already been developed and put into operation? In this respect, I think we could propose that the deputies pass the law but postpone its entry into force until January 1, 2014. As I said, the system is already in operation, and with respect to people on high and middle incomes who have voluntarily decided to join pension funds, whether state or private, it would be right not to deprive them of this opportunity and let them continue using it after January 1, 2014. In other words, those who wish to stay in this system should be able to do so. We need to give people the choice. I think this would send the market a good signal too in the sense that it would give the financial organisations working in the pension sector the opportunity and economic rationale to continue their activities in this sector.  There is another issue I want to draw to the attention of the Government and State Duma deputies. First, in 2014, we will need to balance the social funds’ budgets a little differently from the current proposals in order to take account of the additional revenue that will come in. We also need to give our attention to the use of the money coming into the state and private pension funds. No one would dispute that the regulatory framework still needs to be improved and that a system of effective and transparent oversight still needs to be put in place. I think the existing instruments are sufficient, but if we keep this system in the decades to come, the state authorities must be absolutely confident and people must be absolutely certain that these funds are being used in accordance with the law and that we are not building any financial pyramids.  These are the issues we will need to settle very quickly. Regarding the pension formula, I know that the Government is already working on it, and it must be ready and approved within the first half of next year at the latest. As for using the already considerable sums of money the pension funds have collected, including the state [pension] fund, I expect the Finance Ministry and the Government to settle this matter overall and present proposals for using the long-term money that these pension savings represent. The funds have already collected almost two trillion rubles, at least, the figure will reach almost two trillion by the end of the year. We need to have the laws and government regulations in place making it possible to issue infrastructure bonds that would let us invest this money in reliable, long-term and profitable infrastructure projects.  We have been discussing this issue practically ever since we first introduced the system back in 2002–2003. Unfortunately, the relevant mechanisms have still not been developed. I ask you to complete work on developing these mechanisms by the end of the year, because we have already spent the last 18 months telling the public and each other about how we are going to make effective use of this money to help develop our country’s economy, and we all know that the most effective and reliable use is infrastructure: roads, railways, aviation and so on. But it is the Government’s job to work together with the relevant experts to decide the best actual means and areas in which to invest this money. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16823, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting on pension system development', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin held a meeting on developing Russia’s pension system.', 'tags': ['Pensions'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, colleagues, We are here to discuss an issue of great importance for our economy and social sector.

You have elected a new president, Alexander Brechalov. I want to congratulate you and to thank the outgoing head [Sergei Borisov] for our joint efforts. Mr Borisov and I used to hold regular meetings, we met on many occasions and our discussions were highly beneficial because many of the issues Mr Borisov raised were acute and business, including small and medium business, considered these issues highly relevant. In fact, Mr Borisov did not just bring problems to our attention but he usually also proposed ways to resolve them. I am sure he also consulted with you and discussed all these matters. Recently, a very constructive dialogue has developed between the Government and the business community, particularly through business associations, including your organisation. I would like to note that the number of SMEs in Russia has been growing, although it is still below what we would like to see. In countries with developed market economies the SMEs’contribution to national GDP is much higher than in Russia. Our figure is around 21–22%, whereas in the United States is it 50% and it is even higher in other countries, for example in China it is over 60% and even more in Indonesia.

The meeting focused on the issues faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in Russia.', 'tags': ['Public control', 'Support for business'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, colleagues, Your organisation’s congress has just finished and I know that it was a milestone event since it marked the 10th anniversary of OPORA RUSSIA. You have elected a new president, Alexander Brechalov. I want to congratulate you and to thank the outgoing head [Sergei Borisov] for our joint efforts. Mr Borisov and I used to hold regular meetings, we met on many occasions and our discussions were highly beneficial because many of the issues Mr Borisov raised were acute and business, including small and medium business, considered these issues highly relevant. In fact, Mr Borisov did not just bring problems to our attention but he usually also proposed ways to resolve them. I am sure he also consulted with you and discussed all these matters. Recently, a very constructive dialogue has developed between the Government and the business community, particularly through business associations, including your organisation. I would like to note that the number of SMEs in Russia has been growing, although it is still below what we would like to see. In countries with developed market economies the SMEs’contribution to national GDP is much higher than in Russia. Our figure is around 21–22%, whereas in the United States is it 50% and it is even higher in other countries, for example in China it is over 60% and even more in Indonesia.

Petersburg Dialogue is an open forum for discussing current issues in Russian-German relations. Meetings take place every year, alternating between the two countries, with politicians, academics, cultural figures, and journalists from both countries taking part. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ms Federal Chancellor, Mr de Maiziere, Mr Zubkov, ladies and gentlemen, I also want to wish a warm welcome to everyone taking part in this XII meeting of the Petersburg Dialogue public forum. I am very pleased to see that from its beginnings a few years ago, the dialogue has developed so fast and is gaining in scope and quality all the time. The fact that youth organisations are joining in your work too is a very good sign that this kind of forum does have a future. It is symbolic that the forum’s events are taking part within the framework of the reciprocal Years of Russia and Germany. Their motto – Building the Future Together – is also symbolic. I think it is a fitting motto and a very fitting desire. Over the 12 years since it began, as I said, Petersburg Dialogue has become an important platform for developing new ideas and public initiatives, including within the large-scale Partnership for Modernisation programme. This programme has already been tried and tested at the bilateral Russian-German level, and will now serve as the basis for building relations between Russia and the European Union. I note by the way that Germany is one of our biggest trade and economic partners. It was our biggest partner until just recently. The People’s Republic of China is now in the number one spot, but Germany holds a strong second place. Germany is our biggest partner in Europe in any case. In this respect, our ties in all different areas, including humanitarian ties, cultural exchanges and so on, are all extremely important as they strengthen the general base for cooperation. The theme of today’s forum is Russia and Germany: The Information Society Facing the Challenges of the 21st Century. The Federal Chancellor said just now that she hopes that young people will push officials to work more actively in this direction. I can tell you that we in Russia are also taking steps in this area at the official level. We have the Information Society state programme, for example, which was launched a few years ago and covers the 2011–2020 period. Our goal is to be among the top ten countries in the world in the international ranking for information technology development by 2020, and among the top twenty for development of electronic government and networks in society. I remind you that Russia was one of the first countries in the world where people could follow the presidential election through direct online broadcasting from all polling stations. Overall, this had a positive impact on the election process. Of course, there are limits to this kind of election monitoring, but the positive aspects are nonetheless clear. We will actively develop various forms of electronic democracy. In particular, the Russian parliament will have a duty to examine any popular initiative that collects at least 100,000 identifiable signatures online. We see big opportunities for using internet technology at the municipal and regional levels too. Colleagues, I will not comment right now on the problems that have been raised so far today. We have representatives from German and Russian youth organisations present here today. The Federal Chancellor mentioned the visa issue just before. This problem is real and is definitely a factor limiting development of our multilateral relations. We think that we will be able to settle this issue through a process of dialogue with the European Union, and we hope for our German friends’ support in this area.  Whether in Russia, Germany, or other countries, there is still much to do in order to ensure unrestricted freedom of speech and at the same time protect people from those who try to use modern technology to spread their message of nationalism, intolerance, violence and aggression, and who seek to profit from vice. In this area we not only welcome proposals from our partners and the chance to work together to find solutions, but we also believe that civil society organisations, with their inherent persistence, can help to resolve many of these sensitive issues, and the politicians, of course, must give them all necessary assistance. As I just said, we are big trade and economic partners. There are now more than 600 companies with Russian capital registered in Germany, including many small and medium-sized businesses. They cooperate closely and work directly with the public, at the grassroots level. These small businesses create new jobs and new opportunities for our goods and latest technological advances. German investment in the Russian economy now comes to the impressive sum of $25 billion. Russian companies’ investment in the German economy is also growing from one year to the next. I do not want to make a long speech. It is with pleasure that we will listen to what you all have to say. I am sure that you have prepared some questions and proposals for discussion. I think that a real live dialogue and this kind of direct contact will be a lot more interesting than listening to the Federal Chancellor and myself deliver long monologues.

Ms Angela Merkel and I have just discussed a whole range of bilateral matters, taken a detailed look at our bilateral trade, investment, and humanitarian ties, and examined current international issues. Before that, we had a lively and interesting discussion with the participants in the XII Petersburg Dialogue public forum. We will also be meeting with Russian and German business leaders. We have made quite a lot of progress in expanding our bilateral ties since the last round of interstate consultations in Hannover in July 2011. The high-level bilateral working group is working effectively and we are coordinating our work on strategic cooperation issues in the economic and financial spheres. Germany has strengthened its position as one of our main foreign trade partners. Our bilateral trade came to $54.6 billion over the first three quarters of this year – up 5.6 percent on same period in 2011. I think this is quite positive given the current economic difficulties in Europe. There has been an increase in German capital in the Russian economy, with total German investment now coming to $25 billion. Russian business for its part is starting to expand its presence on the German market, and total Russian investment is now close to $6 billion. Contacts between our citizens are increasing. The heads of most of the key ministries and agencies are all present here today. This is essentially a joint meeting of the Russian and German governments. I think that these consultations, which began some years ago now, are an effective mechanism that lets us meet directly to discuss the most important issues before our two countries. The ministers will report today on the progress made in developing our bilateral cooperation. I know that there has been thorough preparation on both sides. I hope the reports will reflect not just the current state of affairs, but will also propose possible solutions to the existing problems and propose future initiatives. It is important that we get an assessment of all the different areas of cooperation. I note that each speaker will only have two or three minutes, and so I ask you to be brief and keep to the time limit, but at the same time, we are not sticklers to the point where we will not let you go a second over. If you need to say a couple of words more, you need not fear. Before giving the floor to the first of the ministers, I want to stress that expanding our bilateral trade, economic, and investment cooperation is a definite priority for Russia. We want to develop closer production cooperation with German companies and work more actively to attract German technology and capital. The innovation and research fields offer a vast range of new opportunities. This includes not just projects in areas such as supercomputers, nano- and bio-technology, but also in more traditional sectors such as the automotive and machine-building industries, making car parts, the energy sector and many other areas. Small and medium-sized businesses also need to have a place in this cooperation. Interregional ties are definitely a resource for developing bilateral cooperation. It is in our common interest to put more energy into developing contacts between our citizens and expanding tourism, cultural, and educational exchanges. The big reciprocal programme of the Year of Russia in Germany and Year of Germany in Russia, Russia’s participation in the Hannover Industrial Fair in April 2013 and Germany’s participation in the St Petersburg International Economic Forum on June 20–22, as well as many other bilateral and multilateral events will give us more than enough cooperation opportunities over the coming future. I am sure that the strategic partnership between our countries will develop for our peoples’ benefit. Of course, before giving the floor to the ministers for the start of the discussion, I would ask the Federal Chancellor to say a few words. Please go ahead. Federal Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel     Merkel AngelaFederal Chancellor of Germany  (retranslated): Thank you very much. We are happy to be here at the 14th round of interstate consultations in Moscow. The high level of the delegations – we have almost the entire cabinet of ministers here – shows that these consultations give us the chance to discuss things much more intensively than is usually the case at the international level, work together and approve new projects. I think the fact that we have so many ministries taking part shows the breadth and diversity of our relations. We have a very high level of economic cooperation. More than 6,000 German companies have operations in Russia. This shows what diversified cooperation we have in this area. We also have many opportunities for working together in the social sector, the environment, and other areas. Our countries’ partnership for modernisation also shows that we are developing and building up our contacts in education, science, and civil society too. Germany is more than happy to develop relations with Russia in this broad range of areas, so as to have the chance to openly discuss all issues in the spirit of strategic partnership and common interests. Of course, we can also have different interests too. Germany supports intensive cooperation between the European Union and Russia because without the European Union we cannot resolve many of the existing problems. Looking at the economic side of things in Europe, we are to remember that 90 percent of economic growth today is taking place outside the European Union. Russia in this respect is our dynamic partner and we will intensify our cooperation. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16851, 'place': '', 'title': 'Beginning of Russian-German interstate consultations', 'teaser': '', 'tags': [], 'transcript_filtered': 'Ms Federal Chancellor, colleagues, We have a very busy programme today.

            "{'date': '2012-11-16T20:30:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ms Federal Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen, First of all I would like to thank our German partners for their constructive and fruitful cooperation. This, the 14th session of interstate consultations, was significant judged by both the number of participants – almost 30 heads of ministries and agencies from both parties – and the detailed nature of our discussions. We spoke in detail about a widest variety of topical issues, ranging from the economy and finance to cooperation in security and culture. We confirmed the special nature of our strategic dialogue, which focuses on achieving visible results that benefit both our countries and nations. Our trade and economic relations are developing well. It suffices to mention that last year, in 2011, bilateral trade grew by 37 percent to a record $72 billion. This year, our trade continues to gain momentum and has already increased by 5.6 percent with respect to the previous year. You agree that generally this is a good trend. it is a very positive element in a difficult economic context, or rather the difficult economic situation in the world and in Europe specifically. The aggregate German investments in the Russian economy are close to $25 billion and some of them are intended to launch most efficient production and introduce most advanced technologies. German businesses are represented in many sectors of Russia’s economy, including strategic ones, and operate in almost all of the country’s regions. However, we understand that our potential for cooperation is far from exhausted. Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has opened new opportunities. I would like to thank again Ms Federal Chancellor and all of our German partners for their continued support of Russia's WTO accession. The negotiations were not easy, but they were constructive and had a positive outcome. Our countries have already engaged in full-scale industrial cooperation. Innovative breakthrough projects are being implemented in the automotive industry, transport engineering, medical technology production and other fields. I would also underscore our close cooperation in the energy sector. A month ago the second leg of the Nord Stream pipeline became operational and thus became another carrier ensuring the energy security for Europe as a whole. I must say that it is well-known that Germany is becoming a major, important hub for the distribution of Russian energy resources to the rest of Europe. I am sure that the documents signed today on railway transport and the production of electrical equipment will help more closely coordinate Russia’s and Germany’s research, industrial, and resource potential. Following our news conference Ms Federal Chancellor and I will meet with CEOs of major German and Russian companies. I think we will have a very useful and interesting conversation. Of course during our consultations we touched on humanitarian ties, which largely derive from our lasting friendship, cooperation and the desire to expand these contacts in all areas. We have no small number of fresh ideas, new projects, and initiatives. This summer the Year of Germany in Russia and the Year of Russia in Germany were launched under the symbolic motto: Building the Future Together. The agenda of these events provides that in April 2013 Russia will act as Germany’s main partner in the world-famous Hannover Messe. In turn, we would be very pleased to welcome Ms Federal Chancellor as the guest of honour at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum that will take place in June 2013. At our talks we also exchanged views on topical international issues and Russia’s impending G20 presidency.  In conclusion I would like to say a few words about the Petersburg Dialogue Russian-German public forum whose participants we met today. I would mention that this particular forum benefits from a dynamic, engaging atmosphere and a substantive agenda. Over more than ten years it has become a useful forum to discuss the most sensitive, sometimes controversial issues and proved its relevance and effectiveness. It is encouraging to see that more and more young people are participating in its work. This means that all the initiatives, projects, and plans that we are currently making together will continue in the future. Once again I would like to thank Ms Federal Chancellor and all our partners for the constructive discussion and significant work today. Thank you very much for your attention. Federal Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel     Merkel AngelaFederal Chancellor of Germany  (retranslated): Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President of the Russian Federation on behalf of our entire delegation for the reception here in the Kremlin. We have just finished our 14th round of interstate consultations. And the number of ministries represented here and the agreements that have been signed reflect the breadth and range of our ties. Russia has vast resources while Germany would like to help Russia modernise its high-tech sector and infrastructure which makes us strategic partners. Cooperation in this respect is very close, but it’s just one aspect of our cooperation. More than 6,000 German companies operate in Russia. The more predictable the investment environment is, the more our trade will grow. The current dynamic is clearly positive.  Russia will be our partner at the Hannover Messe in 2013. I have invited President Putin to be our guest and to continue our discussions there. Of course we talked about preparations for Russia's G20 presidency next year. What happens within that forum is particularly important. Russia has adopted a very clear position with regards to the problems concerning the indebtedness of industrial countries, and this position will continue to be important within the G20. We observed a very lively discussion at the Petersburg Dialogue forum at the beginning of our meeting, and it was led by the young people who are present here. We should think about how to improve our youth exchanges. At the bilateral level we talked about the situation in Russian civil society, and I voiced my concerns about certain legislative projects. We are to talk openly about these issues, and our conversation and dialogue are prerequisites to understanding each other and talking about conflicts. Overall I am very pleased. A large team from the Federal Republic of Germany and our government came here today, and I think our talks will continue on all levels. Now I think that we can go to questions. Question (retranslated): Madam Chancellor, you have just mentioned your concern about the pressure on civil society in Russia. What information will you take home with you? Do you think you were able to achieve anything? Mr President, could you tell us why you see critical individuals and organisations as a danger to your country? And what have you learned from the history of the GDR? In connection with the Pussy Riot case, you mentioned some effigies of Jews. Nobody can remember such an anti-Semitic stunt. What exactly was it about? Vladimir Putin: About a year ago, the same group or at least one of its members placed three effigies in a Moscow supermarket bearing the labels “Jew”, “migrant” and one other category, and demanded that Moscow be feed of those people. I believe that this is a direct anti-Semitic attack and I think you should realise what kind of people we are dealing with. I don’t think that modern Germany should support anti-Semitism. We have never seen such stunts in Germany. I just wanted to point out that when we discuss certain things we have to understand all sides of the issue. As for offending religious feelings and insulting the Church, as far as I know, although I’m not an expert on German law, it is a criminal offense in Germany that is punishable with imprisonment of up to three years. Angela Merkel: We discussed various legislative measures in great detail. And for my part, I reiterated what I think is very important: if society has a good level of education, the middle class can develop; if there is free economic activity, different groups are formed that have conflicting views. In order for that to happen, a certain atmosphere must be created. The Russian President explained for his part the results of certain legislative initiatives and the motives behind them. When we have conversations like that, it becomes obvious that we have different opinions on some issues, but on other matters our facts and realities are different. I think that this exchange should be continued. We know each other so well that we can have very intensive meetings. The more we work together at different levels of society, the more it becomes clear how much potential lies in the free development of a society. For me this meeting has confirmed that it is very useful to meet and talk, and we will continue these meetings. Question: I have a question for Chancellor Merkel and for President Putin. Madam Chancellor, I assume that you and President Putin discussed gas supplies to Germany. We know that Russia is not very happy with the so-called Third Energy Package of the European Union. We know that the Third Energy Package provides for the separation of the transportation and sale of gas. The European Union believes that this will bring new players to the market and foster competition, which will lead to lower prices for consumers. Here in Russia, there are people who believe the opposite: that this will create additional organisations, the established supply chains will be violated and the prices will rise rather than fall as a result. As they say, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. What do you think about this? I also have a question for Mr President. There are a lot of journalists here, a record number, and we have been talking about various issues. There is a great interest is the fate of the former Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov. It was reported recently that he has become an adviser to Russian Technologies State Corporation, but later this was denied. Could you clarify the situation with Mr Serdyukov? Thank you. Angela Merkel: I would like to say a few words about gas supplies. The construction of the Nord Stream pipeline has been a great success, and as a result Germany has become a strategic player as regards gas supplies to Europe. The construction was completed in a very short time. The problem is that the European rules require that the raw material that is transported be separated from the pipelines used for this purpose. The European Union held very heated debates on this matter as pertaining to power lines and railways. The EU has very different philosophical approaches to protecting competition. Germany was not always able to ensure the acceptance of its ideas. This compromise is reflected in the Third Energy Package. President Putin and I spoke about this very often. I believe it is best to accept these things as they are and use the freedom that they provide. It would be impossible to make sure that a single pipeline is used to transport exclusively Russian gas. However, should there be no second supplier who would use the pipeline, I will advocate in Brussels the use of the existing pipeline to full capacity. Vladimir Putin: I also say a few words on the subject of energy. Naturally, any one of our partners is free to make any decision under its jurisdiction, and we will always treat those decisions with respect. The Third Energy Package is a harmful document, but that is our opinion. Our European partners have the right to do what they want. The only thing we object to is when laws are applied retroactively. In my opinion, that is absolutely unacceptable and it is an uncivilised way of solving problems. If we invest money, if Russian and German companies invest billions into a project in compliance with the existing laws and regulations, how can we have any confidence in what will happen to these investments if we don’t know what decision will be adopted and applied retroactively? I think this position is absolutely logical. And we would like to ask our European partners (this is not addressed to Madam Chancellor, but primarily to the European Commission) to bear this in mind and to build relationships with their partners, including Russian partners, in such ways as not to violate the generally accepted principles of international law. As for power lines and railways, there are different factors at play from gas supply. I hope that this will all be taken into account. We are in contact, we are not overdramatising anything and we expect that we will be able to reach agreement. Now for the domestic issues and the scandals involving the Defence Ministry. This is a very unfortunate situation. As you know, I made the decision to release Minister Serdyukov from his duties based on the fact that there has been some doubt as to his ability as a minister to resolve property issues. I want to emphasise that there is no legal case against Mr Serdyukov and there is no investigation. The general practice is that a person is considered innocent until proven guilty by the court. Does that mean that he has no right to work anywhere else? Please note that the role of an adviser is not associated with the management of property or staff. It is a purely expert function. The rumour that he is working in some capacity, say, as an adviser at the Russian Technologies, is false. He is not working anywhere at present. But if he wants to find a job and is employed by someone, I do not think that we should interfere. He has the right to employment. This is not 1937. Question (retranslated): Madam Federal Chancellor, Mr President, You said that you spoke about international issues today. Did you discuss Syria? Have your views on the situation moved closer to each other in regard to the assessment of Bashar al-Assad and the opposition? I have one more question. How concerned are you about the recent events in Israel and Palestine? Vladimir Putin: Frankly, we mainly talked about the current situation in Palestine and the conflict between Israel and the Gaza Strip. We talked about the deterioration in the relations between Israel and Egypt, which we are very concerned about. My impression was that our positions on the situation are very close. However, we have not yet had the opportunity to talk on the Syrian crisis in detail. We will have a meeting with business people now, which is not the best venue for such a discussion, but we will have a chance to talk about Syria. Russia’s position on the issue is well known. We believe that first it is necessary to agree on the future, to understand how the legal rights and interests of various ethnic and religious groups will be guaranteed, and only then proceed to change. And not the other way around – remove Assad and then think about what to do next. We have seen problems that arise as a result of this approach in Libya and in other countries. We all know what the outcome of the Libyan crisis has been: the disintegration of the state, the murder of diplomats, including the American ambassador. In short, the country is in chaos. Who wants chaos in Syria? We certainly don’t. It is too close to our border. Angela Merkel: As for Syria, the situation has changed in the last few days, because the Syrian opposition has rallied together. We will see how strong the coalition will be. Our foreign ministers spoke at greater length about the subject. We talked more about the crisis in the Middle East and the escalation of violence. I stressed that I view this situation with great concern, as does the Russian President. Hamas bears the responsibility for the rocket attacks. There can be no justification for this violence, because Israeli civilians have suffered as a result. We hold very similar opinions that the Egyptian Government should put pressure on Hamas to stop the escalation of violence and adopt a more moderate tone, because the victims of the attacks are mostly civilians. The region is very sensitive, and that was at the focus of our discussion today. Question: Mr President, I have a question, if I may. The European Union has recently been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize but is now going through a profound economic crisis that has threatened the very existence of the EU. I would like to ask how Russia views the continued existence of the euro, considering that about 40% of its foreign currency reserves are in euros, as well as the survival of the European Union? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: We have not the slightest doubt about the viability of the European Union and the euro, otherwise we would not hold 40% of our foreign currency reserves in euros, and they are the third biggest reserves in the world. We are confident that the EU will recover from the current difficulties. I personally support the Federal Chancellor’s approach to resolving all the complex problems that have arisen in Europe. It is not our business, we are not going to interfere, but I think that first it is necessary to repair the machine, and only then load it with petrol, or money in this case. It seems to me that this is a valid approach. I am sure that in the end the fundamentals of the European economy and European integration will prevail and will help the EU countries cope with the current problems. Nevertheless, we must think about it, and today we talked mainly about ways to strengthen our cooperation, to emphasise the strategic nature of cooperation between Russia and the Federal Republic of Germany, and not only in the economy but also in other areas, including the humanitarian sphere. We also remembered today that Russia will host major international sporting events soon, including the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In order to emphasise the special trust-based strategic nature of relations between Germany and Russia, I proposed that in 2018 the German national football team plays for Russia, and the Russian team for Germany. (Laughter.) Mr Guido Westerwelle is waving his arms, I am not sure if he is delighted or indignant about my idea. You shouldn’t think that my proposal stems from a lack of confidence in our athletes – we have absolute confidence in their abilities. But I think that the athletes would have a much greater sense of responsibility if they played for a different country. The question remains open so let’s think about it. But imagine this: you refuse my offer, and then our team completely thrashes Germany. That would be interesting to see. Then you’ll be sorry. In sport anything is possible, you know. Angela Merkel: I would like to add a few words in answer to your question. The European Union is going through a very difficult period and yet it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize at this time, which spurs us on to further strengthen the European Union. Every crisis eventually gives rise to new opportunities and prospects. Now we have the opportunity to work and to strengthen the foundations that perhaps are not very strong at present. We have achieved more in the past two and a half years that in the preceding periods. The euro has proved itself as a very stable currency. The euro inflation rate is lower than the German mark had in the last 10 years of its existence. The euro has been stable, although there have been variations in the individual member states. The euro will help us achieve successful European growth, and cooperation between the Eurozone and Russia is an important direction for the future. As for football, I will not accept any proposals.\", 'kremlin_id': 16852, 'place': 'The Kremlin, Moscow', 'title': 'Joint news conference following Russian-German interstate consultations', 'teaser': '', 'tags': ['Foreign policy'], 'transcript_filtered': \"Ms Federal Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen, First of all I would like to thank our German partners for their constructive and fruitful cooperation. This, the 14th session of interstate consultations, was significant judged by both the number of participants – almost 30 heads of ministries and agencies from both parties – and the detailed nature of our discussions. We spoke in detail about a widest variety of topical issues, ranging from the economy and finance to cooperation in security and culture. We confirmed the special nature of our strategic dialogue, which focuses on achieving visible results that benefit both our countries and nations. Our trade and economic relations are developing well. It suffices to mention that last year, in 2011, bilateral trade grew by 37 percent to a record $72 billion. This year, our trade continues to gain momentum and has already increased by 5.6 percent with respect to the previous year. You agree that generally this is a good trend. it is a very positive element in a difficult economic context, or rather the difficult economic situation in the world and in Europe specifically. The aggregate German investments in the Russian economy are close to $25 billion and some of them are intended to launch most efficient production and introduce most advanced technologies. German businesses are represented in many sectors of Russia’s economy, including strategic ones, and operate in almost all of the country’s regions. However, we understand that our potential for cooperation is far from exhausted. Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has opened new opportunities. I would like to thank again Ms Federal Chancellor and all of our German partners for their continued support of Russia's WTO accession. The negotiations were not easy, but they were constructive and had a positive outcome. Our countries have already engaged in full-scale industrial cooperation. Innovative breakthrough projects are being implemented in the automotive industry, transport engineering, medical technology production and other fields. I would also underscore our close cooperation in the energy sector. A month ago the second leg of the Nord Stream pipeline became operational and thus became another carrier ensuring the energy security for Europe as a whole. I must say that it is well-known that Germany is becoming a major, important hub for the distribution of Russian energy resources to the rest of Europe. I am sure that the documents signed today on railway transport and the production of electrical equipment will help more closely coordinate Russia’s and Germany’s research, industrial, and resource potential. Following our news conference Ms Federal Chancellor and I will meet with CEOs of major German and Russian companies. I think we will have a very useful and interesting conversation. Of course during our consultations we touched on humanitarian ties, which largely derive from our lasting friendship, cooperation and the desire to expand these contacts in all areas. We have no small number of fresh ideas, new projects, and initiatives. This summer the Year of Germany in Russia and the Year of Russia in Germany were launched under the symbolic motto: Building the Future Together. The agenda of these events provides that in April 2013 Russia will act as Germany’s main partner in the world-famous Hannover Messe. In turn, we would be very pleased to welcome Ms Federal Chancellor as the guest of honour at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum that will take place in June 2013. At our talks we also exchanged views on topical international issues and Russia’s impending G20 presidency.  In conclusion I would like to say a few words about the Petersburg Dialogue Russian-German public forum whose participants we met today. I would mention that this particular forum benefits from a dynamic, engaging atmosphere and a substantive agenda. Over more than ten years it has become a useful forum to discuss the most sensitive, sometimes controversial issues and proved its relevance and effectiveness. It is encouraging to see that more and more young people are participating in its work. This means that all the initiatives, projects, and plans that we are currently making together will continue in the future. Once again I would like to thank Ms Federal Chancellor and all our partners for the constructive discussion and significant work today. Thank you very much for your attention. Federal Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel     Merkel AngelaFederal Chancellor of Germany  (retranslated): Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President of the Russian Federation on behalf of our entire delegation for the reception here in the Kremlin. We have just finished our 14th round of interstate consultations. And the number of ministries represented here and the agreements that have been signed reflect the breadth and range of our ties. Russia has vast resources while Germany would like to help Russia modernise its high-tech sector and infrastructure which makes us strategic partners. Cooperation in this respect is very close, but it’s just one aspect of our cooperation. More than 6,000 German companies operate in Russia. The more predictable the investment environment is, the more our trade will grow. The current dynamic is clearly positive.  Russia will be our partner at the Hannover Messe in 2013. I have invited President Putin to be our guest and to continue our discussions there. Of course we talked about preparations for Russia's G20 presidency next year. What happens within that forum is particularly important. Russia has adopted a very clear position with regards to the problems concerning the indebtedness of industrial countries, and this position will continue to be important within the G20. We observed a very lively discussion at the Petersburg Dialogue forum at the beginning of our meeting, and it was led by the young people who are present here. We should think about how to improve our youth exchanges. At the bilateral level we talked about the situation in Russian civil society, and I voiced my concerns about certain legislative projects. We are to talk openly about these issues, and our conversation and dialogue are prerequisites to understanding each other and talking about conflicts. Overall I am very pleased. A large team from the Federal Republic of Germany and our government came here today, and I think our talks will continue on all levels. Now I think that we can go to questions. Question (retranslated): Madam Chancellor, you have just mentioned your concern about the pressure on civil society in Russia. What information will you take home with you? Do you think you were able to achieve anything? Mr President, could you tell us why you see critical individuals and organisations as a danger to your country? And what have you learned from the history of the GDR? In connection with the Pussy Riot case, you mentioned some effigies of Jews. Nobody can remember such an anti-Semitic stunt. What exactly was it about? About a year ago, the same group or at least one of its members placed three effigies in a Moscow supermarket bearing the labels “Jew”, “migrant” and one other category, and demanded that Moscow be feed of those people. I believe that this is a direct anti-Semitic attack and I think you should realise what kind of people we are dealing with. I don’t think that modern Germany should support anti-Semitism. We have never seen such stunts in Germany. I just wanted to point out that when we discuss certain things we have to understand all sides of the issue. As for offending religious feelings and insulting the Church, as far as I know, although I’m not an expert on German law, it is a criminal offense in Germany that is punishable with imprisonment of up to three years. I also say a few words on the subject of energy. Naturally, any one of our partners is free to make any decision under its jurisdiction, and we will always treat those decisions with respect. The Third Energy Package is a harmful document, but that is our opinion. Our European partners have the right to do what they want. The only thing we object to is when laws are applied retroactively.

What shall we start with? Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin     Rogozin DmitryGeneral Director of the Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities : Mr President, I want to start with the defence procurement orders for this year as they stand at the moment. To date, 94.3 percent of the orders from the main customer – the Defence Ministry – have been placed, and the orders from all other customers have been placed. The main problems that we face are more or less the same issues that we discussed during the meetings you held over the summer: changes to the orders once the contracts have been placed. In other words, the demands placed on the companies performing the contracts change too often. As far as financing goes, the situation looks a lot better this year than in 2011, but there are still problems. The problem is above all in systemic planning of the defence procurement orders.  Now the intergovernmental working group headed by the Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office [Sergei Ivanov     Ivanov SergeiSpecial Presidential Representative for Environmental Protection, Ecology and Transport ] has been set up to monitor performance and placement of defence procurement contracts, and its members include the people responsible for these matters. Also, in accordance with your Executive Order, the Federal Service for Defence Contracts has been brought under the Government’s responsibility, has had its powers substantially increased and can carry out objective oversight of defence procurement contracts. I hope that these steps will enable us to improve the situation. Overall, in accordance with the state arms programme, we have already started drafting the new state arms programme for 2016–2025 three years and three months ahead of the new financial period. We will soon submit to you draft executive order on procedures for drafting the arms programme. These procedures will reduce the risk of mistakes because we will carry out a thorough analysis of the materials and technological capabilities in the industry in terms of being able to perform specific contracts and requirements. In other words, we are acting in accordance with your instructions and hope to see an improvement in the situation already next year.  Vladimir Putin: The general price-setting principles need to be settled. This has been the subject of much discussion and there are many problems here. You have already had enough trouble with this yourself, but we still have yet to see a common set of principles. Dmitry Rogozin: This is true. Unfortunately, with work still being handled in manual regime, things reach the point where you, the President, have to make the decisions yourself on the most complicated cases, nuclear submarines, for example. We hope though, that the State Duma and Federation Council will pass the law on state defence procurement by the end of the year. This law will give both the people placing and performing the orders a lot more room to manoeuvre in terms of choosing the optimum state contracts that will take into account the specific situation with each kind of good – more technologically complex goods and simpler products.  Vladimir Putin: Work together with the economic bloc in the Government to get this completed. This matter needs to be settled. Dmitry Rogozin: Yes, Mr President. I also want to inform you about a few decisions regarding optimising the industry itself. You recently signed an executive order on developing the Tactical Missile Corporation’s work. Now, in accordance with this decision, we are concentrating intellectual, testing, and industrial potential in this important sector of developing cruise missiles.  We now need to take another important step to concentrate industrial potential. I am referring here to the ammunition and firearms sector, which we work with on a daily basis, but which is in a very problematic situation at the moment. I have a proposal to make, Mr President, and I hope for your support.  In Izhevsk, our main firearms industry centre, we have two enterprises, Izhmash and Izhmekh, and both are in a troubled state. They have a lot of problems because there were no Defence Ministry orders for years. The Defence Ministry already has a lot of automatic firearms in its stockpiles and therefore did not place orders for new weapons. But there are orders for civilian firearms and sports and hunting guns. In order to concentrate potential and preserve Izhevsk’s industrial capability, I propose merging these two makers to form a company within the Rostekhnologii State Corporation under the Kalashnikov brand. This is a truly global brand.  When I was Russia’s envoy to NATO in Brussels, I often noticed the completely unique and I would say barbaric attitude to Russian brands, including copying our guns and other weapons without getting our permission and without paying any attention to copyright. I therefore hope you will support this merger plan so that we can combine the design potential and develop a modern mass-production firearms manufacturer. Second, in accordance with your words at the latest meeting of the Commission for Military Technology Cooperation, I propose that we begin a decisive combat to protect Russian designers’ copyright on the global market. Vladimir Putin: This is something we should long since have started doing. In actual fact, we are always making attempts in this direction, but what we need is a more concerted effort now. As for the merger proposal, this is possible of course. The goal must be to improve the situation and under no circumstances make things worse. Of course, there are always many social issues that arise in these sorts of cases, and I ask you to give them your closest attention. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16859, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Working meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin', 'teaser': 'Mr Rogozin briefed Vladimir Putin on the situation with the state defence procurement orders and put forward a proposal to unite two Izhevsk arms makers into a single company – Kalashnikov Company.', 'tags': ['Armed Forces'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Mr Rogozin, you have a broad range of responsibilities.

Indeed, a record quantity of freight has been shipped via the Northern Sea Route this year, and the navigation season has lasted a record long time. It is good to see that our vessel and our icebreaker are working there. In this respect, I want to ask you how the work on the Yamal LNG project is going? chairman of the Management Board of Novatek Gas Company Leonid Mikhelson: Everything is going to plan, Mr President. Our partner does not have a big stake (Total holds a 20 percent stake), but it is a reliable partner, and the most important thing is that everything is going to plan. We have almost completed the preliminary FEED project design work and have submitted the project for evaluation. We have productive cooperation with the State Expert Evaluation Department and with environmental evaluation officials, and we are thankful to them for this. We expect to get the results from them within a month. A tender for EPC contracts is underway. We should have all the bids in by the first half of December, and we will then have practically all the information and permits we need to examine the investment decision. Vladimir Putin: Your company, together with Gazprom, or Gazpromexport, rather, is responsible for the work to conclude preliminary contracts for LNG exports to the main customers abroad. We know the procedures for this kind of work and know that investment can be raised only — or chiefly at least — on the basis of existing contracts. I hope therefore that, though little depends on you here, you will nonetheless carry out this work together with Gazprom very soon.  Leonid Mikhelson: We held a big road show on all the markets and already have preliminary proposals. Once we get the final proposals from the EPC contractors we will be able to give a guaranteed date for filling the first tanker and will be able to sign sales contracts. There are some small technical matters related to our legislation that we will need to settle in order to open the way for project financing. Perhaps I could present a written report on this matter later.  The main thing is that we are keeping to schedule. It is also very important that the instructions given in the December 2010 resolution are also being carried out as planned, and for this we say a big thank you to the Transport Ministry and other agencies. We have begun the work on building a seaport at Sabetta. We are also building an airport in the settlement of Sabetta. A contract for building the first new atomic icebreaker has been signed. The authorities support this project and everything is being carried out as per the resolution. Vladimir Putin: I discussed this matter recently with Gazprom’s heads and I think that the future port’s capacity could be expanded. It could definitely become a multipurpose port. I ask you to work on this matter together with your colleagues and with the Transport Ministry. Leonid Mikhelson: We looked at the matter of how in principle to organise an investment project for building a branch railway line to Sabetta from Gazprom’s line to the Bovanenkovo field. The big issue is not so much finding the investment as the tariff policy – having a common tariff and having Russian Railways responsible for all of the transportation. This is the real question. If we have the railway there then the port really will be a multipurpose facility. Vladimir Putin: This is what we must do then, all the more so as the state authorities are going to invest in the canal leading to the port anyway. Every ruble invested must be spent as effectively as possible. Leonid Mikhelson: Of course. Vladimir Putin: What is your situation today on the domestic market? Leonid Mikhelson: We are developing well on the domestic market. We will sell more than 60 billion cubic metres of gas this year and plan for sales of around 70 billion cubic metres next year, taking into account the volumes we purchase from SIBUR. Our strategy of choosing the best customers was probably not entirely the best, and so two years ago we changed it and are now working as Gazprom does, following the regional principle. We cover almost all of Chelyabinsk Region and are looking at other regions too, the housing and utilities sector and households, and we are also looking at developing gas distribution organisations and working with new customers. The problem we have run into, Mr President, is that, unlike the segment under Gazprom’s high pressure, the lower segment of the domestic gas market is still working according to rules set forth 20 years ago and that are completely unsuitable for today’s situation with regards to all the permits, approvals and fuel regimes. Small and medium-sized business and little enterprises all want to get gas and end up spending from 18 months to 3 years going through all the procedures. If possible, we would like to make our proposals on how to change this situation and speed up development of this segment of the domestic market. I think that consumption of more than 10,000 cubic metres a year requires fuel regime approvals from the Economy Ministry.  Vladimir Putin: Put your proposals on paper and I will ask our colleagues at the Energy Ministry to go through them together with you and Gazprom. Leonid Mikhelson: Thank you, Mr President.

However, today we will talk about work and the Service’s performance. We can already discuss the estimated results for this year and the implementation of the plan. Head of The Federal Taxation Service Mikhail Mishustin     Mishustin MikhailPrime Minister of the Russian Federation : Thank you, Mr President. In the first nine months of 2012 we have seen a steady growth in tax revenues at all budget levels. In particular, in January — October 2012, the consolidated budget of the Russian Federation received 9.2 trillion rubles, which is 13.3% more than in the corresponding period of 2011. The federal budget received 4.3 trillion rubles, an increase of 15.6%. These increases are higher than inflation, which according to Rosstat [Federal Service for National Statistics] was 4.8% in the first nine months of 2012. In addition, the tax collection growth rate – excluding oil and gas revenues – has remained positive. The consolidated budget, excluding oil and gas revenues, posted a growth rate of 10.8%, and the federal budget – 11.2%. If you look at the share structure (it varies a bit), two taxes make up the main share in Russia’s consolidated budget: income tax and mineral extraction tax, which stand at 22% each. Next comes personal income tax, which makes up 19%, and VAT with 17 %. The share of property tax has increased by 1%: last year it stood at 7 %, and now it is 8%. This has become possible primarily due to the active efforts to resolve the issues associated with the inability to recover and write off debt; debt recovery was impossible because of missed deadlines and errors of the registration authorities, and many other problems that had accumulated over the decades. Mr President, per your directive, this work has been completed without the participation of the public. We wrote off 31 billion rubles of debt, and about 31 million people were involved in this. Vladimir Putin: 31 million? Mikhail Mishustin: That’s right, 31 million Russian citizens. Now, what happened next. We put together all the tax notices that people received into one. There used to be six or seven notices: on transport, property, land tax, etc. Now there is a single tax notice, which shows all accrued taxes and the recipient can make payments online. We make it possible for everyone who wishes to do so to enter into a contract with the Taxation Service and see the accrued taxes in their account on the website. If they do not agree with the charges listed, they can easily send a receipt showing that, for example, this piece of real estate or vehicle is not the property of the individual in question, and they can also clarify any details. Vladimir Putin: And is not subject to taxation. Mikhail Mishustin: Absolutely. Actually, this work has led to an increase in property tax revenues, which we expect to be over 20% compared with last year. This includes transport, property and personal income tax. Vladimir Putin: Are people using this opportunity? Mikhail Mishustin: Yes, so far about a quarter of a million people have registered and started using their private account in one way or another. At first they used their accounts to settle tax arrears, and now it is an opportunity to see all the information the Taxation Service has about an individual.  The next trend is reducing the number of tax disputes. This is very important because the number of disputes used to be very high, and to date the number of complaints from legal entities has fallen by 11%, according to the data for the first nine months of 2012. In the same period in 2011 there were 42,000 complaints, and now that figure is 37,000. The number of court cases involving legal entities has decreased by 20%: there were 44,000 court cases in the first nine months of 2011, and 35,000 cases in the same period this year. The disputes regarding the amounts owed were down by 14% in the first nine months of this year. 200 billion rubles were contested in the same period last year, while today the figure is 173 billion, and we started this effort when it stood at 280 billion rubles. In terms of the load on the courts, the Arbitration Court has reported that it has halved over the past three years. This indicates that higher quality of work with regard to the evidence base and pre-trial audit has allowed us to reduce the costs incurred by people in disputes with the Taxation Service. I would also like to say a few words about online services that are extremely useful, for example to help people make convenient, quick tax payments, find out how to make the payments and how much they need to pay. We have 32 sites where people can find out their tax inspection’s working hours, its address and get all the necessary information needed to calculate their taxes on property, land and vehicles. They can find out if their counterparties are taxpaying businesses. A single state register of legal entities is now available online. In addition, it is now possible to register a business online. This has been recognised by the international community and all these transparent processes have allowed us to move up in the world rankings by 41 positions, from the 105th position to the 64th in tax administration. The amount of time people had to spend filling in tax returns has decreased by three times in the past three years. Now it is 177 hours, despite the fact that the tax burden for a model company we use to calculate the corresponding ratings has increased. This is because of insurance premiums. We are also continuing our efforts to make the registration of companies more transparent. We hope that we will be able to improve Russia’s standing in the world rankings next year. In conclusion, I would like to say that when the heads of the world’s tax services met in Buenos Aires – it is a forum on tax administration held under the auspices of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), it was agreed that the next global conference on tax administration will be held in Moscow. The leaders of OECD member and partner states will visit our country. The meeting will be held in May, during Russia’s chairmanship. Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to make a welcoming address to our colleagues. The issues on the agenda will be very serious, with innovation in tax administration as the main theme of Russia’s chairmanship.

            "{'date': '2012-11-21T18:00:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': '* * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, We are here today to discuss an issue of great importance and complexity, namely, how to protect our national security and economic interests as we enter the initial phase of full membership in the World Trade Organisation. Russia’s accession to the WTO was undoubtedly one of the year’s big events. The accession process took 18 years, as you recall. I think even with China the negotiations were quicker, some 16 or 17 years. We worked consistently towards our goal, without haste I note, aware of the need to secure our economic interests. We debated long and hard with our partners to protect our interests. Membership has its risks but also its advantages. We now are to make the best possible use of these advantages. At the same time, we have to be clearly aware of the risks and problems that WTO membership will bring. We have had quite good macroeconomic results over recent years but still lag behind the developed economies in labour productivity and energy efficiency. Many companies must overhaul their fixed assets as their products often fall short of modern standards in quality, value, and price. WTO membership poses a big challenge to our competitiveness in general, and especially for companies of the kind I just mentioned. But it is precisely for this reason that we hope that joining the WTO will create the incentive required to modernise our economy, improve our business climate, help Russia in the medium term to gain a better place in the international division of labour, and make our market more attractive for capital and direct investment. I stress the point that we can make the most of the advantages WTO membership offers only if we follow a goal-focused, effective and coordinated policy. Such a policy involves actively promoting Russian goods on other countries’ markets and raising large-scale foreign investment for new production facilities that will produce goods not only for the domestic market but for exporting to the global market too. Most goods these days are manufactured through a process of international production and sales cooperation and manufacturing and sales chains. We should integrate into these chains, into the links that bring the highest value added. I note too, that as a member of the WTO we can play a full part in setting the rules governing international trade, and this will put us on an equal footing with the other member countries in obtaining favourable conditions for our goods on foreign markets. Finally, we will have more possibilities for supporting our interests in the World Trade Organisation’s dispute resolution bodies. Obviously, joining the WTO does not mean that we are abandoning our policy of supporting the national economy. But we will need more sophisticated and flexible regulation instruments, including broader use of protection, compensation and antidumping measures, all the more so as our companies often complain that the bodies responsible for taking protective action are indecisive and the formalities take too long. In this area we can and have to learn from the old timers in the WTO, who use a variety of very sophisticated measures without violating any rules. We should realise that our economy will have to make a big adaptation effort and reach a new level of competitiveness and openness during the initial period of our functioning within the WTO. It is possible we will encounter some difficulties in the short term, especially at the moment when global growth rates have slowed down. The global market today is characterised by low demand and investment activity. This creates the risk that we might not get quick positive results from WTO membership. But pursuing an effective policy to attract investment could partially offset the negative impact of global stagnation. The fact remains though, that the crisis situation on the global markets increases the risks related to these new obligations we have taken on, above all our obligations to lower import duties on a number of goods. Colleagues, let me remind you that all of us, even those not directly involved in the economy, realised during the concluding stage of the negotiation process to just what extent the global economy could slide into recession, and we realised full well that our partners made concessions in many areas and agreed to some of our demands, understanding the obligations as we did, and trying to secure guaranteed access to our markets. We made a conscious decision to accept these risks. Overall, I can say that we have joined the WTO on far more advantageous terms than did many of our neighbours and partners, but this does not lessen the risks related to global recession. We did everything necessary during the negotiations to give our companies the chance to adapt to the new situation and rules. Nevertheless, some sectors could face particular problems, above all in some areas of livestock farming, agricultural machinery, the automotive sector, light industry, food processing, pharmaceuticals and manufacturing medical equipment. I note too that in the global crisis situation Russia’s membership in the WTO could create additional difficulties in regions with little economic diversification, in single-industry towns, for example. The closure of loss-making, ineffective companies, especially big enterprises, could increase unemployment and create social risks. There is also the risk of regional budgets seeing their revenue fall. Ultimately, this could increase the gap between regions in terms of social and economic development, and this is a serious challenge. We must minimise these risks and negative effects and protect our people’s interests. Colleagues, we discussed this a year ago in the previous Government, and together with the previous Presidential Executive Office began to draft a package of measures to reduce these risks. We are here now to discuss these measures. The Government is to draw up an action plan for adapting particular economic sectors to the new situation that our WTO membership creates. Some of the required measures have already been carried out, but these are just the first steps. We now have to make a thorough analysis of the situation at every level of government, identify the systemic, sector-specific, and regional problems, and act fast to solve them. Of course, we must make a serious effort to establish the institutional structures and mechanisms that will protect and promote our country’s interests, including within the WTO’s dispute resolution body. In this respect I want to draw the following points to your attention. First, we are to make a comprehensive assessment of the effect WTO membership will have on our labour market. Unemployment has fallen steadily over the last decade in Russia. Even during the most difficult period, the crisis year of 2009, unemployment was only 8.4 percent, and today it is not more than 5.2 percent of the working population. We should maintain these positive trends and not allow unemployment to rise in the single-industry towns and regions with a high concentration of businesses in the risk groups I mentioned before. The Labour Ministry and the Government’s economic officials have to analyse thoroughly the effects joining the WTO will have on our labour market and propose within the coming months specific measures to minimise the negative effects. Second, as I said, we will continue to protect our industry’s interests. Our partners all do this, whether the EU countries, the USA, or other WTO members. We too should draft a package of long-term measures to protect key economic sectors. These measures are needed at both the federal and regional level. But I want to stress that support should go first and foremost to companies that are examples of best production practice. Only effective companies producing competitive goods that have a future should receive this support. Propping up technologically backward businesses, poor quality products and low-paid jobs is a dead-end road. In their respect it is other issues – social issues – that we have to resolve. Third, WTO membership will require all of the economic agencies to improve their work, and we will need to improve the quality of our economic diplomacy. Russia’s trade missions abroad have the task of monitoring the situation on foreign markets and signalling hostile action taken towards Russian companies. The Economic Development, Trade and Industry, and Foreign Ministries, for their part, must act to remove discriminatory sanctions imposed on our companies. It is of principle importance that all of the basic information on our economy’s functioning within the WTO is open and that Russian business has access to it. In this respect, I ask the Economic Development Ministry to organise publication of an electronic bulletin on WTO issues and publish all of the documents on its official website. The fourth point is closely linked to the third point. We are to train people able to provide qualified assistance in securing Russian companies’ interests in the new environment and take an active part in working in the WTO’s key organisations. The qualities and skills that people who will work in this area should have is also something we are to discuss today. I would like to hear the views of the Economic Development Ministry and Foreign Ministry representatives present. Finally, Russia must continue its integration into the global economy. We are currently continuing our negotiations on joining the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and hope to complete the accession process soon. This is something we also have to keep in mind for the future. Colleagues, resolving all of these tasks will require systemic and coordinated work from every branch of power and all of the regions, as well as from the business community and public organisations. I am sure that this cooperation will go ahead. Let me say again that joining the WTO offers us many new tactical and strategic advantages and will encourage our economic development and help to raise people’s living standards. But we must take all possible steps to protect ourselves against the potential risks too, and reliably guarantee our country’s and people’s security. This is clearly a very complex matter that concerns the interests and possibilities of many ministries and agencies, and this is why we decided to meet in this expanded format today to discuss this issue in the Security Council. Let’s start work. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16868, 'place': 'The Kremlin, Moscow', 'title': 'Expanded format meeting of the Security Council', 'teaser': 'Measures to protect Russian economic interests and national security as the Russian economy begins operating within the World Trade Organisation were the main subject of discussion.', 'tags': ['National security', 'WTO'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, colleagues, We are here today to discuss an issue of great importance and complexity, namely, how to protect our national security and economic interests as we enter the initial phase of full membership in the World Trade Organisation.

This is clearly a very complex matter that concerns the interests and possibilities of many ministries and agencies, and this is why we decided to meet in this expanded format today to discuss this issue in the Security Council.

The plan is to increase its capital by 50 billion rubles [over $1.6 billion], a substantial sum, with allocations from the 2012 federal budget. The funding will be injected in the development of the energy industry in the Far East, in particular the following facilities: the thermal power station in Sovetskaya Gavan, Sakhalin GRES-2 (first stage), Yakutskaya GRES-2 (first stage) and the Blagoveshchenskaya Thermal Power Station (second stage). The executive order includes instructions to the relevant agencies to ensure an efficient use of budget funds, which must be spent for the intended purpose. These conditions must be fulfilled meticulously and I want to emphasise this to Mr Ishayev as a federal minister and Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District, as well as to the company’s management. You must exercise strict control over all subsequent actions taken after the company’s recapitalisation. I hope I have made myself clear and you understand the situation. Any further steps to develop the company or its various divisions are possible only with regard to the interests of the state and the investment made in the relevant facilities. Let us discuss this in more detail now. MINISTER IN CHARGE OF RUSSIA’S FAR EAST DEVELOPMENT AND PRESIDENTIAL PLENIPOTENTIARY ENVOY TO THE FAR EASTERN FEDERAL DISTRICT Viktor Ishayev     Ishayev Viktor : Thank you. Mr President, energy is a fundamental industry that determines the overall development of the Far East. The facilities that have been selected are essential. First, the degree of depreciation is significant and the people are waiting for these issues to be resolved. We have been discussing these matters for a long time. New, more efficient technologies and types of fuel will be introduced. Certain facilities will run on both gas and coal. This is the right decision given the diversification of fuel, and we have already seen that the system itself will generate additional revenues by reducing costs. This may not lead to an immediate reduction in tariffs, but at least the tariff growth rate will be stabilised, which is a very positive fact that will benefit both individual consumers and manufacturers. If we improve the situation in the energy sector, the region will immediately become more attractive for investment, and this will serve as an impetus and a signal from the government to investors. Thank you very much for signing the executive order. Vladimir Putin: All my visits to the region and the analysis of the economic situation there show that inequality in energy tariffs leads to inequality in economic activity and in the living standards. Therefore, we must begin our efforts to develop and support the region with the energy industry. This is just one of the steps we plan to take to promote the development of East Siberia and the Far East. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16869, 'place': '', 'title': 'Working meeting with Viktor Ishayev and Yevgeny Dod', 'teaser': 'During his meeting with Minister in charge of Russia’s Far East Development and Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District Viktor Ishayev and RusHydro CEO Yevgeny Dod, Vladimir Putin announced that he had signed an Executive Order on the development of the energy industry in East Siberia and the Far East.', 'tags': ['Energy', 'Regions'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, colleagues, I have signed an executive order on the development of Federal Hydrogenerating Company RusHydro.

We will review new projects that have been proposed by ASI, talk about the prospects and discuss another set of roadmaps to improve the business climate. Let me remind you that the first time the Supervisory Board held a meeting was a year ago. We approved a number of projects and an action plan for ASI. Later, we significantly expanded the scope of the Agency’s activities, instructing the team to create a platform for the implementation of the National Business Initiative to Improve the Investment Climate in the Russian Federation. All tasks assigned to the Agency correspond to its mission: to search for and support outstanding leaders with new approaches to management; their ideas, energy and commitment to achieve their goals should be the driving force of change. I consider the involvement of such individuals in the national development drive to be a strategic task and a key to success of the action programme in the coming years. I would like to note that the implementation of individual projects supported by ASI encourages the replication of effective practices in various fields, from industry to the social sector. For example, the federal standards for the equipment used to transport household gas have been changed through the Agency’s efforts. It appears to be a minor issue at first glance but it is a concrete result achieved in improving gas safety, which is very important, as we all know, and also leads to the creation of a huge new market for modern technology. Another example from a completely different sphere is preschool education. With the help of ASI, the project of constructing preschool centres of a new type has been successfully realised and the initiative for the development of the private preschool education sector is being actively promoted. Such private, family preschools play a significant part in quickly addressing the very acute problem of preschool waiting lists. Another important project supported by the Agency is the Global Education programme, which provides state financing for talented students, young teachers and professionals from around the country studying at leading universities in Russia and abroad. I would like to hear about the progress made by the programme. Incidentally, I believe that the example of the Far Eastern Federal University shows that this programme could be upgraded to include funding for inviting top level, interesting and promising foreign lecturers to come work in Russia, rather than pay for our students to go study abroad. The Far Eastern Federal University has an interesting practice, which I have talked about before: they held competitions for outstanding scientists (they had 10 applicants per position) and for foreign lecturers (4, 5 or 6 applications per position). All we need to do is create the right conditions. Today we will consider several new projects in industry, education and the social sector. I ask you to place special emphasis on the compound, systemic effect these projects will have. Now on the National Business Initiative. It is vitally important that in its efforts in this area the Agency has succeeded in consolidating public and business organisations, in involving companies directly in the preparations and decision-making. We approved the first roadmaps at the last Supervisory Board meeting in May. Today, the Supervisory Board will consider five new roadmaps proposed by the Agency, which contain solutions to optimise the registration of property and new businesses, and to improve the quality of government regulation as a whole. I would like you to focus not only on the registration of new businesses, but also on the initial stages of operation. It is not that hard to register a business in Russia but the organisation of the company’s activities at the initial stage remains extremely difficult. I will not list all these hidden challenges, but there are too many of them, as I am sure you know better than I do. In general, the task is to improve the quality of government regulation, as I said, including through the use of information technology. A separate area is increased access of small and medium-sized businesses to procurement, which is conducted by infrastructure monopolies and companies with state participation. Their procurement is comparable to budgetary expenditures. I would especially like to highlight the roadmap for the development of competition. Recently, a number of important decisions were adopted in the field of antimonopoly regulation. However, these efforts must continue consistently; in particular, we must significantly limit the infringement of competition on the part of the state and municipal authorities. Entrepreneurs must get a real sense of improvement in the competitive environment. As we originally agreed, each road map should set clear objectives and deadlines for individual events, as well as the responsible ministries and agencies. I hope that following this Supervisory Board meeting, the roadmaps will be finalised and approved by the Government in the near future. What points do I want to make in this regard? The practice of introducing the first roadmaps shows that changes do not always happen the way we would like them to. Certain agencies’ attitude to these tasks has been rather perfunctory. All the documents have been signed, the meeting have been held, but businesses see very few changes in practice. Today we invited the top officials of the Federal Customs Service, who are going to report on the practice that has been introduced in line with the roadmap on customs regulation of providing preliminary information about goods and accompanying persons at border checkpoints. Such a mechanism, in the opinion of the business community, can greatly simplify the customs control procedure. However, what we see in practice? The preliminary information provision has been introduced only at road border crossing. Businesses say the introduction of this practice has not helped achieve the main task, which is to reduce the customs clearance time. Mr Belyaninov [Director of the Federal Customs Service] has done a great deal in recent years to improve the performance of the Federal Customs Service: systemic measures are being introduced and structural reforms are carried out. I expect that he will explain to us today why these steps have been implemented in such a limited way. There is always an explanation at hand, but I would rather prefer that we didn’t explain to each other why it is impossible to do something, but instead reported what has been done and what will be done in fulfilling the decisions that have been adopted. Please note that starting this year we will assess the performance of ministries and agencies, as well as governors of the Russian regions in creating a favourable business climate and the actual results achieved. The assessment criteria are clear, including the number of reduced excess procedures, companies’ financial and time outlays, and businesses’ opinion of the state agencies’ performance. The efficiency assessment indicators for federal executive bodies, as well as regional governors have already been approved. I ask the Economic Development Ministry and the Agency for Strategic Initiatives to ensure their implementation. In addition, I believe that the Agency for Strategic Initiatives should establish public and operational control over the implementation of the roadmaps. It should involve all the major business associations in Russia. There should be no room for competition. You must work together with everyone. Moreover, every entrepreneur should have the opportunity to report on the local problems as they arise. Modern information technology makes the development of such a mechanism possible, and I ask the Agency to look into this matter. Please take the necessary actions and steps as soon as possible. Let me stress that any difficulties encountered in the implementation of the roadmaps must be immediately reported to the Supervisory Board. If we do not respond to real-life situations straight away, all these initiatives will get stalled in the red tape. Next. I firmly believe that the preparation of the roadmaps must be accelerated. If we want to become the best, meaning not only the Agency for Strategic Initiatives but our economy as a whole, we must move faster than our competitors, and this is especially important after Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation. We cannot postpone key measures until later while we limit ourselves to minor cosmetic changes. We must adopt a systemic and comprehensive response to every problem faced by businesses. At the end of the year, we will hold a State Council meeting devoted to the quality of the investment climate in the regions, and I would ask everyone here to prepare serious, well thought out proposals. We promised to entrepreneurs that we would radically improve the business environment, that we will make 100 steps to improving the business climate. Therefore, participation in the development of roadmaps and the implementation of approved measures should be a key priority for all executive government bodies. Through the National Business Initiative and project implementation, ASI has acquired a new interaction format or created a new format in relations between the state and society, and new mechanisms for broad public participation. The Agency’s valuable positive experience must be used in the future, including in the execution of other important and responsible tasks. I have a proposal in this regard, which I think is impressive in its scale, as they say. Many ambitious, interesting initiatives are currently being implemented in the new communication environments; the Internet has different communities, digital libraries, websites, civic and charity initiatives, e-learning portals, as well as just games, which is also good. Those resources instantly attract hundreds of thousands or even millions of users around the world. We have a lot of young people with interesting ideas, a lot of talented programmers, including public activists, who can implement these ideas or use them in their work. It is important to create the conditions for these people to implement their projects here in Russia, at home. We must begin by offering them effective tools for public-private partnerships. I think Russia could establish a special foundation that would select online initiatives and finance those that have high social value and address socially important issues. I can promise that I will help you with the funding for the foundation, we can look for sources of finance. In short, we need a financial source in order to provide jobs for the creative class of young people who are willing and able to work in new environment and who have the skills do it efficiently. We must support them. First of all, our support should go to the projects based on new technology and management solutions, and most importantly, the result of such initiatives should be a new quality of life for our citizens. The foundation will sponsor only those projects that have already attracted a certain amount of resources, primarily from private individuals and the users of such online products through the process of collective funding. It may become necessary to introduce amendments to our legislation. The work must be absolutely transparent, that is, each participant, each project initiator must have a clear understanding of how his or her application is processed, and which criteria are used to make the decisions on the allocation of funding. I think that this should become a priority area in the Agency’s activities, and I expect you to submit concrete proposals on the foundation’s organisation. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16871, 'place': 'The Kremlin, Moscow', 'title': 'Meeting of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives Supervisory Board', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives Supervisory Board.', 'tags': ['Professional training', 'Support for business'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, colleagues, Today’s meeting of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives Supervisory Board has a very full agenda.

            "{'date': '2012-11-23T12:30:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': '* * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Artemyev, we have spoken a lot about the need to promote a favourable environment for encouraging investment in our economy. This includes both Russian and foreign investment. You have drafted amendments to the federal law on foreign investment in strategic enterprises. I propose that we take a closer look at them now, see just what they are about. Let’s discuss them. Director of The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service Igor Artemyev     Artemyev IgorHead of the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service : Mr President, following your instruction, a second round of amendments is being made to liberalise the law on foreign investment in strategic sectors of the Russian economy [Federal Law No. 57FZ On Procedures for Carrying Out Foreign Investment in Economic Organisations of Strategic Importance for National Defence and Security]. The Government has approved these amendments, which, after being examined at a Government meeting, will go before the State Duma. The idea of the new proposals on simplifying procedures for foreign investment is roughly as follows. First, they cover the use of pathogenic organisms able to cause category III and IV infectious diseases in foodstuffs production. This means that investment in various dairy plants and food processing plants will no longer have to go before the commission first, as the simplified rules do away with this procedure. Furthermore, companies that already hold a 75-percent stake and obtain the necessary approvals will also not have to go before the commission if they want to buy shares over and above this figure. There are quite a few companies in this situation. Third, in the case of Russian companies carrying out share issues on foreign markets, monitoring that the threshold for control of strategic companies is not exceeded will be the task of the companies themselves. At the approval stage with the commission there will be no restrictions on these companies’ placements on foreign exchanges. This settles one of the big issues and will make it a lot easier for Russian investment, both domestic and abroad. More to that, the Russian regions will have the right to act without having to get the commission’s approval in the case of Russian residents and taxpayers buying Russian strategic assets. At the moment, this right exists only at federal, not regional level. A number of other new provisions are being introduced. The issue of banks is being settled completely and this law will no longer apply to them at all. The law will be clearer and more precise, and takes into account the experience the government commission has built up over these last three years. We held a lot of meetings with foreign investors and they have given our initiatives a very positive assessment.

Interros Holding Company President Vladimir Potanin: Mr President, I know that you are keeping personal watch on everything related to the Olympic preparations. I therefore want to update you on the Russian International Olympic University, which is up and running and carrying out study programmes. As you know, 10 programmes are already underway and dozens of people have already received training, mostly personnel for the upcoming Sochi Olympics and for sports facilities in the regions. From September next year the university will operate as a full-fledged establishment with its own new buildings, and we plan to open the next academic year in full. In this respect, since you are the chairman of the university’s board of trustees, I wanted to ask if it would be possible to time the board’s meeting for this date – the academic year’s start. Vladimir Putin: Yes, of course let’s do this. Vladimir Potanin: This will give us the chance to discuss all of the various matters that have built up. Vladimir Putin: Yes, with pleasure, let’s do this. Vladimir Potanin: Thank you. We will wait then for more specific instructions from you on this matter. Vladimir Putin: How is work progressing on the Olympic facilities you are involved in? Vladimir Potanin: Thank you for taking an interest. We are putting a lot of care and thought into this work, after all, we will be playing host to athletes and tourists from around the world, and we have to be up to the task and put on a good showing. The third operating season will be starting soon. We plan to open the season on December 22. It will be quite different to last year. We hope to make a big stride forward and have every reason to expect that we will succeed. You visited the sites last year and saw that the slopes were quite well prepared. I would say that they were up to a good standard in fact, and we had positive responses too. But we only had 38 kilometres of trails then, whereas this year we will have 60 kilometres in operation, and 90 by the time the Olympics begin. As for the hotels, you will recall that we opened two hotels in test regime, and we will have five operating this year. They can take almost 1,000 people now. Of course, we will have them running at full capacity by the time of the Olympics. This year will see the ski resort become a full-fledged resort of European standard. Let me stress that this is not the average European standard, but the top quality level. This is not just our own opinion. Many specialists share this view, including sportspeople who have skied here, amateur skiers, and experts from the International Olympic Committee. Everyone rates the resort very highly, including Jean-Claude Killy, the International Olympic Committee’s person responsible for overseeing these Olympics. He is himself a three-time Olympic champion and knows a good trail when he sees it. Both publicly and in private conversations he said that the resort is indeed shaping up into a facility of the highest level. Vladimir Putin: The trails there are good, as are the equipment, ski-lifts, and the hotels, so you have everything you need. Vladimir Potanin: It is nice to know that not only can we compete with the best resorts but in some things can even surpass them. Vladimir Putin: You know what you should do? You are to get the various organisations together and agree on operating all of the trails together so that people will be able to buy a ski pass and ski on both sides of the valley. Vladimir Potanin: Mr President, we are already working on this with our neighbours. We have Gazprom on one side and Alpika Service on the other, and we are already holding the technical discussions on this matter. This is indeed something we have to do. At all the ski resorts you always have the neighbouring stations working together this way because it is convenient for visitors and for the resort owners and operators. It is more advantageous to do things this way, and we will definitely do this too. Vladimir Putin: This will increase the resort’s quality and make it more attractive. It will also improve it a lot from the commercial point of view. Vladimir Potanin: Absolutely. We will do this, Mr President. We have 90 kilometres of trails, and together with our neighbours we will have more than 200 kilometres. Of course this will make the skiing more interesting.

I want to talk with you today as President of the National Olympic Committee about the preparations for the test competitions at facilities in Sochi and about several other matters too, in particular, promoting the Olympic movement and sports in general. I know that the Russian Olympic Committee does a lot of work in this area, including with the help of our Olympic athletes. Please, go ahead. President of The Russian Olympic Committee Alexander Zhukov     Zhukov AlexanderFirst Deputy Speaker of the State Duma : Mr President, last year, we launched a big programme – Olympic Classes in Schools. You even took part in one class. We have held more than 1,000 such classes so far this year, conducted by outstanding sportspeople and Olympic athletes. They come to the schools and tell the children about the Olympic movement and about their own sporting life and achievements. I have taken part in many of these classes. The children’s eyes light up when they see a real Olympic champion before them. We held a class just recently with Alexander Mikhailin [silver medallist in judo at the 2012 Olympics]. I am sure that these classes get many children interested and make them want to start playing sports themselves. I see this as a very important programme and we have had an excellent response from our Olympic athletes. We have published a textbook for schools on the Olympic movement’s history. I believe the Olympic ideals are in themselves very important and think that children should know this history, and so we will continue this programme. We are starting another programme now, one aimed at the sports-loving public in general. The idea here is to create fan zones in various cities during big competitions. This idea was first tried out at the London Olympics and it worked very well. People get together at stadiums, watch competition broadcasts on big screens together and support the players and athletes. I think this would also do a lot to help promote sports. This year, we have many test competitions scheduled to go ahead at the Olympic facilities in Sochi, including top level events. We will be holding the figure skating Grand Prix final, for example, this December. We have many talented young sportspeople today. We hope that this season will be a major stage in getting ready for the events in Sochi. We will be hosting world cup competitions in alpine skiing, biathlon, bobsled, and the youth ice hockey world championship. In short, almost all of the Olympic facilities will get tested in top-level competitions. It is also extremely important of course that our athletes have the chance to start training right now for the Olympics at the Olympic facilities themselves. Training at the bobsled track began recently (this is one of the most important facilities). As you know, the alpine skiing trails were completed and opened for use last year, and we will be making full use of the ski trails and the biathlon stadium in this year’s programme of events. These facilities use the medium peaks around Sochi, and this is an area that plays an important part in preparing for the Olympics. Our teams and athletes are training now according to the individual plans and timetables, and we see these test competitions as one of the big stages in getting ready for the Olympics. Vladimir Putin: Do you think that all of the facilities will be ready on time? Alexander Zhukov: We are certain they will be. We hope to have them ready as soon as possible so as to give our athletes maximum time to train there. We are already working together with [State Corporation] Olimpstroy on all of the facilities. The main thing is to ensure that they are as best suited as possible for our teams’ training needs. We have put together what I would call several experimental teams that are at work at the moment, studying the facilities’ particularities and the athletes’ training needs. Vladimir Putin: What about the infrastructure facilities? Alexander Zhukov: The infrastructure facilities are nearly all ready now. The railway — one of the most important facilities — will be in operation very soon, as will the roads. They are probably the most important things. Vladimir Putin: We will go and visit. I haven’t been there for a long time. We will go and take a look. Alexander Zhukov: Mr President, we invite you to come to the test competitions. I think they will be very interesting. They start in December. There will also be many events in January and February. The whole season will be full of top-level competitions. You can come and take a look and support our athletes too.

This work has reached the final stage. Let’s start our discussion with this. Deputy Prime Minister and Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy To the North Caucasus Federal District Alexander Khloponin     Khloponin Alexander : Mr President, in accordance with your instructions, we must submit to the Government a draft state programme for the development of the North Caucasus by December 1. The programme has two main priorities. First, it focuses on the development of social infrastructure, whose importance you have emphasised. Indeed, the situation in this area is difficult. The birth rate is high: only in 2011 we had population growth of 90,000. The forecast is that population in the federal district will reach 10 million people in the near future. At the same time, the number of children attending preschools is only 58% of the national average, which is a very low figure. Almost 51% of educational institutions are working in three shifts; at present 600,000 children attend school in shifts. Infant mortality is very high: around 164% of the national average. Therefore, one of the objectives that we have set for ourselves under the state programme is the development of social infrastructure. We have agreed the indicators with the Finance Ministry and major investment will begin in 2016. The second priority is economic development. This part of the programme is broken up into large anchor projects that are currently underway and are planned for implementation without government support, and a number of investment projects that are state-supported by the state guarantee scheme and in other ways, including the tourism cluster, which we have discussed and which is advancing, and the development of medium-sized businesses, which is also a key initiative for the North Caucasus and is being implemented through the Northern Caucasus Development Corporation. Once again, the programme will be introduced by December 1, and we are planning to discuss it at a Government meeting on December 13. Everything is going according to schedule.

This vast region has played a special role throughout Russia’s history and today our country can move forward successfully only if we ensure this region’s dynamic development. The Far East has vast forests and enormous sources of clean water, some of the largest in the world; it is rich in natural resources, most of which are undeveloped, as we know. Over 100 ethnic groups populate this region, including indigenous peoples and those who came to expand the empire to the east. This region has become their homeland. They invested their hard work, knowledge and creativity in the region’s development, they built new cities, the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Baikal-Amur Mainline (BAM). By the way, very soon, in 2014, we will mark the 40th anniversary of the start of BAM construction. I believe that we should celebrate this event and pay tribute to the people who implemented this ambitious project. Bear in mind that there are still people in the area who have been there since the railway was built, and they are virtually homeless, living in temporary settlements that cannot even be officially classified as housing. They cannot be put on the waiting list [for housing] as residents of dilapidated housing, because technically and legally these settlements are not housing. Last year I looked into the problems faced by one of those settlements, but that is not enough, we need some kind of a nationwide decision on the matter. It is the duty of the federal authorities to address this problem. In any case, these development projects I have mentioned were on a national scale. I want to emphasise that the modern development plans for the Trans-Baikal Territory and the Far East have the same national importance. Our goal is not only to realise these regions’ rich potential; we must take full advantage of its proximity to the Asia-Pacific region, a major developing region with large countries. We must take advantage of this proximity to promote the development of the Far East and Russia as a whole. We have to make a significant contribution to the integration processes in the Asia-Pacific region. These future prospects were confirmed and the recent APEC summit in Vladivostok. In recent years we have taken a number of steps to promote the development of the Far East. Investment was increased and a number of major infrastructure projects were launched. These efforts are bearing some results. In the pre-crisis years the GRP growth rate in the Far Eastern Federal District was lower than the national average, but in 2010, the Far Eastern economy was growing faster than the rest of Russia. In addition, there was no decline in the gross regional product during the crisis. However, I must make it clear that we cannot be satisfied with the pace and, most importantly, the quality of development in the Far East, and the standard of living. The Far East remains behind its neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region and other regions of the Russian Federation. Our task is to reverse this situation and to transform the Trans-Baikal Territory and the Far East into economic leaders. We must implement large-scale, complex projects that will breathe new life into the region. The State Council working group has proposed a number of initiatives and we should discuss them today. That is the main reason for this meeting. I want to emphasise that we have no right to view the Far East exclusively as a source of raw materials. We must ensure its modern, sustainable development, and in general we must find new, more effective approaches to the implementation of our programmes, to planning and management. It is essential that we overcome the situation where the rate at which problems are addressed is unacceptably slow, when the considerable financial and material resources allocated disappear, and the approved plans often remain on paper. I agree with the working group’s proposal to analyse the effectiveness of the measures that have been taken. The Government should carry out such monitoring on a continuous basis. It is already clear that the fragmented, isolated measures are not sufficient. The development of such vast regions requires a long-term strategy and consistency. All of these approaches must be included in the federal programme for the socioeconomic development of the Far East and the Trans-Baikal Territory until 2025. The Government has been charged with drafting new substantive proposals. However, this order has not been fulfilled yet. I want to emphasise that it will have to be done. I urge you to do so as quickly as possible, so that we do not argue over this. I don’t want to put pressure on you or resort to sanctions. We must all realise that this is a very important national task. I ask you today to pay special attention to the projects to be included in the state programme. We must adopt it by the end of the first quarter of 2013. I should add that the 2012 budget provides for additional allocations for the eastern regions of more than 100 billion rubles [over $3.2 billion]. Now, the control system. Of course, it cannot be considered effective. The Ministry for the Development of the Far East has been a disappointment so far. For example, on November 13 the federal programmes for the eastern regions were transferred from the Regional Development Ministry to the Ministry for the Development of the Far East. As a result, we see blurred responsibilities and failures in the work. We must create a monitoring system that would be consistent with the aims of accelerated development of Russia’s eastern regions. In particular, we discussed the idea of a state corporation. I know that this approach is not widely shared but I am ready to return to this issue. We must propose measures that will be effective. Let’s consider other possible management arrangements that could be introduced. Above all, they must correspond to the complexity of the tasks we will be addressing. I emphasise that governors will play a special role in achieving the regional development objectives. The responsibility of the governors and regional authorities should increase manifold. Their work will come under the toughest scrutiny during this period of large-scale transformations. Colleagues, what are the most important aspects of the development of the Trans-Baikal Territory and the Far East? First of all, it is the creation of not just favourable, but unique conditions for business. There are several suggestions in this regard. In particular, I propose to introduce a zero rate for federal profit tax during the first ten years of operation of new production facilities, the so-called greenfields. This will apply to industrial enterprises with investment of over 500 million rubles. We could also consider (and the Government should analyse) introducing an exemption from the severance tax for solid minerals, subject to the same requirements: investment of over 500 million rubles. As for hydrocarbons, these decisions have already been made. Another suggestion we could think about (and I ask the Government to look into this) is amending the existing legislation to ensure that regional authorities could provide tax concessions, even introducing a zero rate, and not a reduction of 4.5%, as it is today. But in that case corresponding amendments to the law should be made. I ask you to analyse this in a very short time and submit your proposals. This is with regard to profit tax. In addition, I suggest we consider the mechanism of incorporating regional tax incentives in the allocation of federal grants to equalise the fiscal capacity of the Far East and the Trans-Baikal Territory. This can be of great help for those regions and become a real financial incentive for ambitious projects. Let us discuss all of these proposals today. A few words about the Fund for the Development of the Far East and the Baikal Region. It provides support for investment projects through public-private partnerships. We have already made a decision to increase its charter capital by 15 billion rubles. We will analyse its work, and if the Fund proves its effectiveness, we will continue to replenish its capital so that it eventually reaches 100 billion rubles. I would like to highlight the use of natural resources in the eastern regions. First, we must check compliance with licensing agreements for the fields, and revoke the licenses of those who have violated their obligations. Second, we must adopt a licensing programme for large undistributed deposits. It must contain an essential condition for the companies to build processing facilities. It should also provide for the creation of mineral resources development and processing clusters as points of accelerated growth. Third. It is necessary to increase by many times the share of processing and high-tech industries, to create a powerful deep processing industry, and to take advantage of the transit and tourism potential of these regions. An essential condition for the region’s development is the construction of transport infrastructure and power generation capacity. At present, over 100 million tonnes of cargo have been registered for shipment by BAM, for example. Meanwhile, its capacity is only 16 million tonnes, as many of you know. 100 million tonnes registered against the capacity of only 16 million. I propose that today we discuss the opportunities for increasing the capacity of the Trans-Siberian Railway and BAM, and the main motorways in the Far East and the Trans-Baikal Territory. We must put up additional transmission lines, including along the Trans-Siberian Railways and BAM, build grid facilities for the accelerated implementation of the Eastern Gas Programme, and implement other strategic projects in the energy sector. At the same time, I stress, we must adopt a balanced approach to the selection of investment programmes. We need infrastructure projects that provide a multiplier effect, closely linked with the development of all regions in the Far East. All of our plans in the economic sphere have one main goal: to create an attractive, comfortable environment in the Trans-Baikal Territory and the Far East, so that people want to settle down here, so that they feel the real benefits of living in this region for themselves and their families, so that they have every opportunity to get quality education and modern healthcare, to buy or rent quality housing. We must develop mortgage programmes, allocate land free of charge for the construction of low-rise housing. This is one part of the country where we really can give land away. But this is not enough. There must be local infrastructure in place, and the commissioning of new schools, kindergartens, stadiums and other social facilities must proceed according to schedule. These measures will help to reverse the negative demographic situation in the region and to attract qualified young professionals. Colleagues, I have outlined the most important, fundamental issues that are directly related to the successful development of Russia’s eastern regions. The working group’s report also contains a number of concrete measures. We have a large block of important issues to work through. It is abundantly clear from what I have said that these measures, if they are consistently implemented, could indeed play a significant role in the region’s development. This applies first of all, to economic measures and tax incentives. However, the tax impetus will not be enough. Let’s talk about the entire complex of measures needed for the development of these areas. Over the centuries Russia sought to develop these territories. As we said recently, in the summer, to get from the European Russia to the Far East, you had to travel by ship across the Indian Ocean, and in the winter snow roads were used. That was not so long ago. Nevertheless, despite all the problems, Russia realised the region’s strategic importance and managed to retain control over it. Today, we must do everything possible to achieve its development – efficient, fast, tangible for the local residents and the entire Russian economy. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 16990, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'State Council Presidium meeting', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin chaired a State Council Presidium meeting on developing the Far East and the Trans-Baikal Territory.', 'tags': ['Economy and finance', 'Regions', 'Social services'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, colleagues, Our agenda today contains the key socioeconomic issues of the Trans-Baikal Territory and the Far East.

Today we continue our regular meetings with party faction leaders. These meetings have always been interesting and useful in my view. I can speak for myself with confidence at least. We have always discussed topical issues in international life and domestic policy, economic and social problems. The autumn parliamentary session is in full steam and you have many matters indeed on your agenda. I know that they all get put to intense discussion. This is the way things should be in a parliament. Of course there will be battles. This is only natural. But at the same time, I want to thank you for almost unanimously supporting my package of anti-corruption legislation. These are very important documents. I think that we also made the right decision together to take the next step in our democracy’s development. I am referring here to the new principles for the upper house of parliament’s formation. I know that many of you think we should move on to electing the senators directly. I agree with this idea, but we have to look at the Constitution. The Constitution states that the members of the upper house represent the regions’ legislative and executive branches of power. ‘Represent’ is the key word here. We should therefore think about changing the Constitution. I believe that at our current development stage the new principles we have introduced are entirely in keeping with democratic criteria and give our people greater opportunities to play a part in the upper house’s formation. I know there are some other positive moments worth noting. The budget law has been approved, for a start, and this is an extremely important document. The budget law usually goes through the fiercest debates because it reflects state policy priorities so clearly, and of course its ultimate shape is influenced too by how the representatives of the parties in the parliament view these priorities. This is a natural process. It is good in any case that this work has been completed and with a positive result what’s more. I am sure that we will discuss this too, today. Regional parliamentary and gubernatorial elections have taken place. These were direct secret ballot elections. True, views differ on this whole process, but overall the reaction is positive. I know that some colleagues have expressed concern over the so-called ‘municipal filters’. Let me remind you that we did not invent this idea. One European country has provisions for such filters written into its legislation on its presidential election procedures. We copied it directly. Nearly all of the parliamentary parties got through these filters in any case. There is a point to their existence. After all, if someone wants to work in a particular region, the people living there should know and support them. There is nothing bad in this idea. I remind you too, that newly registered parties – around 26 parties in all, I think – took part in these elections. This is clear evidence that the democratic space is growing. Of course these new political parties could not put up the same level of strong competition as parties already long established on Russia’s political stage, but they will build up their strength and the parties currently in the parliament should keep this in mind. You are to battle for the voters, battle for people’s interests, but battle in such a way that people see the tangible results. In conclusion, let me add that together with my colleagues and the Presidential Executive Office, we are working hard on the final draft of the Annual Presidential Address [to the Federal Assembly]. This was a presidential election year and I made a lot of policy statements in my election campaign articles and the executive orders I issued in May, but the annual address is important and still has to take place.

Mr Putin and Mr Erdogan     Erdogan Recep TayyipPresident of Turkey  made press statements and answered journalists’ questions. * * * Press statement and answers to journalists’ questions President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, The trusting and open spirit in which today’s talks took place and the level of our trade and economic ties give us every reason to consider that we have come to a friendly country. We have come not only to visit a partner and neighbour, but truly have come to a country that is our friend. The High-Level Cooperation Council, which just held its third meeting, has once again confirmed its importance as a bilateral partnership mechanism that has already proven its worth.  The Council’s sector-specific expert groups have done a lot of preparation and ensured that we had a very substantive agenda indeed. We discussed in detail a wide range of issues. I note that our bilateral trade continues to develop fast. Russia is now in solid second place among Turkey’s trade and economic partners. Last year, despite the general decrease in global trade, our bilateral trade increased by 26 percent, and by a further 14 percent over the first nine months of this year. This is an excellent trend and a good result, especially when set against the global economy’s current difficulties. Our objective, as the Prime Minister just said, is to raise our bilateral trade to the $100-billion mark in the coming years. This is a completely realistic goal.  We just signed the trade and economic and science and technology cooperation programme through to 2015. The programme aims to bolster our industrial cooperation and develop bilateral ties in construction, the metals industry and agriculture. It also contains measures to promote cooperation in science-intensive sectors such as telecommunications, space exploration and developing satellite systems. Of course, one of our big cooperation areas is the energy sector, and here, our work together is not limited to fossil fuels, even if they do play a very important part. As the Prime Minister knows, Russia is always ready to give our Turkish partners a shoulder to rely on at difficult times, and if there are any glitches with energy supplies from other countries, we will increase our deliveries at the first demand. We thank our Turkish friends for their decision on the South Stream project. Construction work will begin in a couple of days, and our Turkish partners and friends have been invited to attend this event too. I note too our joint plans to build Turkey’s first nuclear power plant at Akkuyu. This is a big and promising project involving substantial investment — $20 billion. Russia is taking care of the project financing completely. At least a quarter of the total amount will be spent on creating new jobs in Turkey itself. Developing our business partnership’s financial infrastructure is another relevant task today. This involves creating a comfortable and favourable environment for investment and for using our national currencies in mutual settlements, as the Prime Minister mentioned just now. We have just overseen the signing of a number of financial sector agreements. Russia’s Sberbank acquired DenizBank, Turkey’s ninth-biggest bank, in September this year, in a deal worth a total of $3.6 billion. This is one of the biggest deals, if not the biggest, in Europe’s banking sector over the last year. The Council also discussed humanitarian matters at today’s meeting. Our bilateral public forum is beginning its practical work now. As far as humanitarian issues go, education and science are both important areas. I spoke about the nuclear project before, and I want to note that more than 100 students from Turkey are studying in this particular field in Russia. In other words, if the project goes ahead – and so far it is going to schedule – it will help to create a whole new high-tech professional sector in Turkey. There is the tourism sector too. As the Prime Minister noted, 3.5 million Russian tourists visit Turkey every year, and the figure will be even higher this year. This is a sign of our trust in Turkey and its government, a sign of our confidence in your country’s stability. This is what you could call ‘voting with one’s feet’ in the good sense of the term. Russia and Turkey are neighbours and we share many common pages in history, sometimes dramatic pages. It is very important that we treat this heritage with respect. We have just signed an agreement on Russian burial sites in Turkey and Turkish burial sites in Russia. This agreement has great human and moral significance and will allow us to develop work to establish and organise decent memorials to immortalise our forebears’ memory. We have gone through all manner of events in our history, but this is all part of the past now, and we must look toward the future. It makes me very happy to see that our Turkish friends share this view and that this is what we do. Of course, as was mentioned too, we also discussed the international agenda, including the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Syria, and the situation in North Africa and the Middle East in general. Let me conclude by once more thanking the Prime Minister and all of our Turkish friends for these very constructive and productive talks. We have agreed to hold the fourth meeting of High-Level Cooperation Council in Russia in 2013.  Thank you for your attention. Question: A question for the Russian President. Mr Putin, you just said that you discussed Syria. Could you please comment on the humanitarian aspect of this problem since the Turkish side largely focuses on humanitarian issues. Turkey is practically the only country to receive all Syrian refugees. We are talking about hundreds of thousands here, if I’m not mistaken, the latest UN reports give us a figure of 462 thousand. This is truly a huge problem. Was this the perspective you discussed the Syrian conflict from in today’s talks and did you hear what your Turkish colleagues had to say? President of Russia Vladimir Putin: We discussed this problem from many different angles, including the humanitarian aspect. And I must say that our positions fully coincide not only in our judgments of what we see happening in Syria right now but also in terms of what we would like the situation there to be. Right now we can’t find a common position as to the methods we may use to reach these goals, means to settle this conflict. However, as was mentioned before, we have instructed our foreign ministers to hold additional consultations – some new, fresh ideas came up during the talks but I think it’s too early to talk about that. We understand only too well the situation that Turkey found itself in with that refugee inflow. We are fully aware of the fact that it’s extremely difficult to ignore such things as shelling (though I’m sure that these were accidents, but it’s still a fact). It’s a huge burden and a huge moral responsibility. Turkey and Syria are neighbours, and it’s something that we can’t ignore either since this is happening all too close to our state borders. We are in constant contact with our Turkish partners and we will continue this work. Question: A question about energy industry. You spoke about an important project underway in Turkey to build its first nuclear power plant. Do you think this process is already irreversible? Are there any potential risks taking into account the situation that was, for example, in Bulgaria? How good do you think are its implementation prospects? And the second question is also energy-related. We are implementing many joint projects, including the South Stream gas pipeline project you have mentioned. That means that eventually Turkey will become a sort of energy hub. But we have the South Stream, the North Stream and a number of other projects we plan to implement. Do you see any priority among them? How are these projects related? Which are more important and which are less important? How do they correlate? Vladimir Putin: About the NPP prospects. I said that, first of all, everything is to the schedule, no delays, no disruptions. We hope that our Turkish partners make a fair assessment of the risks Russia has assumed. Let me repeat: we have undertaken the 20-billion dollar financing all by ourselves and we hope for the Turkish government’s support. So far, I see no threats to this project. It’s not so much about the construction of the power plant itself as about the creation of a whole new high-tech industry in Turkey, including the training of domestic staff. And I’m sure that there is no other way because the Turkish side is interested in this project. We too are interested, so I see no threats to its implementation. Now, talking about Turkey’s transformation into Europe’s energy hub, this is really so. The key priority for us here is the diversification of routes we use to supply our energy resources to our key markets. You mentioned the North Stream. Yes, that project is completed now, and we are about to launch the South Stream project. But let us remember that we’ve been operating the Blue Stream project for some time now – 16 billion cubic metres of gas we deliver directly to Turkey through this pipeline. It is possible that we can agree with our Turkish partners to expand the Blue Stream gasline to include third countries. Question (retranslated): We see thousands of people in Syria killed and many refugees fleeing the country. Russia opposed sanctions against Syria. Russia also opposes the deployment of the Patriot missile air-defence system. Do you think there’s any guarantee that Syria will not use nuclear weapons against Turkey? Vladimir Putin: Are you serious – Syria has nuclear weapons? It's either something that I don't know about or the translation is inaccurate. Are there any guarantees that Syria won't use nuclear weapons? I think the translation is wrong. Syria is a non-nuclear weapon state and it's far away from producing weapons of mass destruction. This is point number one. But I repeat again, this is only if the translation is correct. As far as the Patriot system is concerned, first of all, it’s not the best system in the world – it’s not new. And second, we share Turkey’s concern about the situation in border areas. We understand well the feelings of the Turkish government and the Turkish people. We call for restraint because creating any extra options in border areas won’t improve the situation or ease the tension there, it will only exacerbate the problem. You know, the Chekhov’s gun principle: if you see a loaded gun on stage in the first act of a play, it will fire off in a later act. Do we need more shooting there? Now, to Russia’s position. You know, we are not the absolute supporters of the Syrian regime, and I’ve already said that. We are not advocates of the incumbent Syrian leadership. Our concern is different: what will the future bring? We don’t want any replay of the mistakes that have been made, in our opinion, in the recent past. Just remember how active was the West in supporting the Libyan rebels. Who could have thought back then that the same people enjoying so much support from the West would bring the situation to a tragedy – murder of a US ambassador. We should think of the consequences before we take a step. I already said that this topic has been actively discussed today with our Turkish colleagues, and some new ideas have been voiced but they require extra review and analysis. We will continue to work hard together with Turkey and the entire international community on ways to resolve this complicated problem. Question (retranslated): As regards extra sanctions against Iran. A statement was made that Russia would render support in terms of sanctions against Iran. Support is also expected from Egypt as regards gas supplies from Russia. A question to President Putin. The international community talks about your visit, which comes after a certain preparation: you made a visit to Turkey, this is your first visit abroad in the recent past. This is seen as renewal of Russia’s trust in its partners. How do you see it? Mr Prime Minister said that the Patriot missile air-defence system will be deployed for security reasons. Do you have any guarantee that Syria won’t attack Turkey? Vladimir Putin: Is this a question for me? Do we guarantee that Syria won’t attack Turkey? We are no guarantors of the situation in the region, we assumed no responsibility, but I’m sure – and you too understand it very well – that Syria has other things to take care of before attacking any of its neighbours. It needs to settle its own problems first. This tragedy, Syria’s shelling of Turkey, I’m sure it’s a pure accident. I have absolutely no doubts about that. We all understand full well that Syria is far from attacking any of its neighbours. It’s absolutely unrealistic, and you don’t have to be an expert here or have any secret intelligence information to understand it – common sense is enough.  But there is no doubt that we must seek to end the violence in that country. And this is something that our Turkish colleagues and we agree on completely, and we share the same approach here. Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan     Erdogan Recep TayyipPresident of Turkey  (retranslated): As regards gas supplies – we have a bilateral agreement with Iran as part of our bilateral relations, it’s a separate issue. Iran is our second largest natural gas supplier after Russia. On the topic of sanctions – will the same sanctions apply against Iran? We cannot be bound by such sanctions. We have stated before that we will continue buying gas from Iran. We will stick to our position because natural gas is a strategic product for Turkey. We must continue with these deliveries and we will supply corresponding goods in exchange. We have stated our position many times and we will stick to our policy in this regard since other countries have similar deals too. So, why would Turkey be restricted in its trade and economic relations? Every country sees after its own economic interests, and it works the same way for Turkey. Thank you for your interest.\", 'kremlin_id': 17019, 'place': 'Istanbul', 'title': 'Working visit to Turkey', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin met with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and took part in a meeting of High-Level Russian-Turkish Cooperation Council.', 'tags': ['Foreign policy'], 'transcript_filtered': \"Mr Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, The trusting and open spirit in which today’s talks took place and the level of our trade and economic ties give us every reason to consider that we have come to a friendly country. We have come not only to visit a partner and neighbour, but truly have come to a country that is our friend. The High-Level Cooperation Council, which just held its third meeting, has once again confirmed its importance as a bilateral partnership mechanism that has already proven its worth.  The Council’s sector-specific expert groups have done a lot of preparation and ensured that we had a very substantive agenda indeed. We discussed in detail a wide range of issues. I note that our bilateral trade continues to develop fast. Russia is now in solid second place among Turkey’s trade and economic partners. Last year, despite the general decrease in global trade, our bilateral trade increased by 26 percent, and by a further 14 percent over the first nine months of this year. This is an excellent trend and a good result, especially when set against the global economy’s current difficulties. Our objective, as the Prime Minister just said, is to raise our bilateral trade to the $100-billion mark in the coming years. This is a completely realistic goal.  We just signed the trade and economic and science and technology cooperation programme through to 2015. The programme aims to bolster our industrial cooperation and develop bilateral ties in construction, the metals industry and agriculture. It also contains measures to promote cooperation in science-intensive sectors such as telecommunications, space exploration and developing satellite systems. Of course, one of our big cooperation areas is the energy sector, and here, our work together is not limited to fossil fuels, even if they do play a very important part. As the Prime Minister knows, Russia is always ready to give our Turkish partners a shoulder to rely on at difficult times, and if there are any glitches with energy supplies from other countries, we will increase our deliveries at the first demand. We thank our Turkish friends for their decision on the South Stream project. Construction work will begin in a couple of days, and our Turkish partners and friends have been invited to attend this event too. I note too our joint plans to build Turkey’s first nuclear power plant at Akkuyu. This is a big and promising project involving substantial investment — $20 billion. Russia is taking care of the project financing completely. At least a quarter of the total amount will be spent on creating new jobs in Turkey itself. Developing our business partnership’s financial infrastructure is another relevant task today. This involves creating a comfortable and favourable environment for investment and for using our national currencies in mutual settlements, as the Prime Minister mentioned just now. We have just overseen the signing of a number of financial sector agreements. Russia’s Sberbank acquired DenizBank, Turkey’s ninth-biggest bank, in September this year, in a deal worth a total of $3.6 billion. This is one of the biggest deals, if not the biggest, in Europe’s banking sector over the last year. The Council also discussed humanitarian matters at today’s meeting. Our bilateral public forum is beginning its practical work now. As far as humanitarian issues go, education and science are both important areas. I spoke about the nuclear project before, and I want to note that more than 100 students from Turkey are studying in this particular field in Russia. In other words, if the project goes ahead – and so far it is going to schedule – it will help to create a whole new high-tech professional sector in Turkey. There is the tourism sector too. As the Prime Minister noted, 3.5 million Russian tourists visit Turkey every year, and the figure will be even higher this year. This is a sign of our trust in Turkey and its government, a sign of our confidence in your country’s stability. This is what you could call ‘voting with one’s feet’ in the good sense of the term. Russia and Turkey are neighbours and we share many common pages in history, sometimes dramatic pages. It is very important that we treat this heritage with respect. We have just signed an agreement on Russian burial sites in Turkey and Turkish burial sites in Russia. This agreement has great human and moral significance and will allow us to develop work to establish and organise decent memorials to immortalise our forebears’ memory. We have gone through all manner of events in our history, but this is all part of the past now, and we must look toward the future. It makes me very happy to see that our Turkish friends share this view and that this is what we do. Of course, as was mentioned too, we also discussed the international agenda, including the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Syria, and the situation in North Africa and the Middle East in general. Let me conclude by once more thanking the Prime Minister and all of our Turkish friends for these very constructive and productive talks. We have agreed to hold the fourth meeting of High-Level Cooperation Council in Russia in 2013.  Thank you for your attention. We discussed this problem from many different angles, including the humanitarian aspect. And I must say that our positions fully coincide not only in our judgments of what we see happening in Syria right now but also in terms of what we would like the situation there to be. Right now we can’t find a common position as to the methods we may use to reach these goals, means to settle this conflict. However, as was mentioned before, we have instructed our foreign ministers to hold additional consultations – some new, fresh ideas came up during the talks but I think it’s too early to talk about that. We understand only too well the situation that Turkey found itself in with that refugee inflow. We are fully aware of the fact that it’s extremely difficult to ignore such things as shelling (though I’m sure that these were accidents, but it’s still a fact). It’s a huge burden and a huge moral responsibility. Turkey and Syria are neighbours, and it’s something that we can’t ignore either since this is happening all too close to our state borders. We are in constant contact with our Turkish partners and we will continue this work. About the NPP prospects. I said that, first of all, everything is to the schedule, no delays, no disruptions. We hope that our Turkish partners make a fair assessment of the risks Russia has assumed. Let me repeat: we have undertaken the 20-billion dollar financing all by ourselves and we hope for the Turkish government’s support. So far, I see no threats to this project. It’s not so much about the construction of the power plant itself as about the creation of a whole new high-tech industry in Turkey, including the training of domestic staff. And I’m sure that there is no other way because the Turkish side is interested in this project. We too are interested, so I see no threats to its implementation. Now, talking about Turkey’s transformation into Europe’s energy hub, this is really so. The key priority for us here is the diversification of routes we use to supply our energy resources to our key markets. You mentioned the North Stream. Yes, that project is completed now, and we are about to launch the South Stream project. But let us remember that we’ve been operating the Blue Stream project for some time now – 16 billion cubic metres of gas we deliver directly to Turkey through this pipeline. It is possible that we can agree with our Turkish partners to expand the Blue Stream gasline to include third countries. Question (retranslated): We see thousands of people in Syria killed and many refugees fleeing the country. Russia opposed sanctions against Syria. Russia also opposes the deployment of the Patriot missile air-defence system. Do you think there’s any guarantee that Syria will not use nuclear weapons against Turkey? Are you serious – Syria has nuclear weapons? It's either something that I don't know about or the translation is inaccurate. Are there any guarantees that Syria won't use nuclear weapons? I think the translation is wrong. Syria is a non-nuclear weapon state and it's far away from producing weapons of mass destruction. This is point number one. But I repeat again, this is only if the translation is correct. As far as the Patriot system is concerned, first of all, it’s not the best system in the world – it’s not new. And second, we share Turkey’s concern about the situation in border areas. We understand well the feelings of the Turkish government and the Turkish people. We call for restraint because creating any extra options in border areas won’t improve the situation or ease the tension there, it will only exacerbate the problem. You know, the Chekhov’s gun principle: if you see a loaded gun on stage in the first act of a play, it will fire off in a later act. Do we need more shooting there? Now, to Russia’s position. You know, we are not the absolute supporters of the Syrian regime, and I’ve already said that. We are not advocates of the incumbent Syrian leadership. Our concern is different: what will the future bring? We don’t want any replay of the mistakes that have been made, in our opinion, in the recent past. Just remember how active was the West in supporting the Libyan rebels. Who could have thought back then that the same people enjoying so much support from the West would bring the situation to a tragedy – murder of a US ambassador. We should think of the consequences before we take a step. I already said that this topic has been actively discussed today with our Turkish colleagues, and some new ideas have been voiced but they require extra review and analysis. We will continue to work hard together with Turkey and the entire international community on ways to resolve this complicated problem. Question (retranslated): As regards extra sanctions against Iran. A statement was made that Russia would render support in terms of sanctions against Iran. Support is also expected from Egypt as regards gas supplies from Russia. A question to President Putin. The international community talks about your visit, which comes after a certain preparation: you made a visit to Turkey, this is your first visit abroad in the recent past. This is seen as renewal of Russia’s trust in its partners. How do you see it? Mr Prime Minister said that the Patriot missile air-defence system will be deployed for security reasons. Do you have any guarantee that Syria won’t attack Turkey? Is this a question for me? Do we guarantee that Syria won’t attack Turkey? We are no guarantors of the situation in the region, we assumed no responsibility, but I’m sure – and you too understand it very well – that Syria has other things to take care of before attacking any of its neighbours. It needs to settle its own problems first. This tragedy, Syria’s shelling of Turkey, I’m sure it’s a pure accident. I have absolutely no doubts about that. We all understand full well that Syria is far from attacking any of its neighbours. It’s absolutely unrealistic, and you don’t have to be an expert here or have any secret intelligence information to understand it – common sense is enough.  But there is no doubt that we must seek to end the violence in that country. And this is something that our Turkish colleagues and we agree on completely, and we share the same approach here. Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan     Erdogan Recep TayyipPresident of Turkey  (retranslated): As regards gas supplies – we have a bilateral agreement with Iran as part of our bilateral relations, it’s a separate issue. Iran is our second largest natural gas supplier after Russia. On the topic of sanctions – will the same sanctions apply against Iran? We cannot be bound by such sanctions. We have stated before that we will continue buying gas from Iran. We will stick to our position because natural gas is a strategic product for Turkey. We must continue with these deliveries and we will supply corresponding goods in exchange. We have stated our position many times and we will stick to our policy in this regard since other countries have similar deals too. So, why would Turkey be restricted in its trade and economic relations? Every country sees after its own economic interests, and it works the same way for Turkey.

In general, our citizens took a positive view of what has been proposed during the election campaign, and these proposals have also been outlined in the presidential executive orders of May 7, 2012. Why do I say this? The point is that the priorities of the federal budget have been set, and I asked you to meet today to assess the situation with regards to regional budgets. We need to understand what’s going on in the regions, since much of the work to meet the government’s commitments to its citizens occurs at the regional level. And it is very important to set the right priorities and to do so promptly, bearing in mind that we are currently working on the regional budgets. These are the issues we are going to discuss today. I would suggest focusing on the following key topics. We’ll talk about a number of issues. First, wage increases for public sector employees. Already in 2012 the teachers’ wages should reach the average for each particular region, and by the beginning of 2013 the wages of preschool teachers will reach the \\u200b\\u200bgeneral education sector’s average. I know that we only started this work – in some regions at least – in September and October, so I understand that it is not possible to reach Russia’s average in 2012. But in 2013 the average wage in the \\u200b\\u200bgeneral education sector should be equal to the average wage in Russia. And we will be monitoring this. I would ask the relevant ministries and agencies to address the problem accordingly. Let me repeat, in 2013 the wages of preschool teachers – and I just said this – must be raised to reach the average level for the \\u200b\\u200bgeneral education sector. Wage targets for other categories of public sector employees have been up to 2018. In this regard, I want to stress that the regions and budget organisations must clearly understand that wage increases depend on structural changes in the social sphere, and these systemic issues must be addressed right away. This has become a proverb already; we have been talking about it for years now, saying that wage increases must go hand in hand with structural changes. And I, your faithful servant, have repeatedly discussed this with heads of various government agencies, and not with one or two people but with associations such as the Russian Rectors’ Union. Everyone understands that structural changes are necessary but, to speak frankly, nothing serious is happening in this area. Let me also remind you that the Government together with the regions must draft regulatory documents to gradually increase the wages of cultural sector employees. This work must be completed as soon as possible. When we met with our colleagues in the Council for Culture and Art, we talked about how this work will begin in January 2013 and wages in federal cultural institutions should increase by as much as 30 percent. I know that not all preparations have been completed so far, and that the [Culture] Ministry is planning to do so in February and March; I expect that it will be done at this time. Each region should have its own plan of bringing the public sector wages to the region’s average by 2018. Today I would suggest that we talk about what is being done and how wage increases affect the quality and accessibility of cultural services, to take the cultural sphere in particular. What else worries us? This October the teachers’ wages in most Russian regions have reached the region’s average wage level for 2011. But I would like to go back to this again: I know that some regions may not be able to achieve the national average this year, but I would draw your attention to the fact that almost all regional leaders said they would be able to. Okay, let’s see what happens in 2013. But it is absolutely clear that public sector wages in 2013 must reach the average wage level. This year only ten Russian regions were able to pay their teachers according to the annual average required. Preschool workers are in the same position. Only in Moscow and Tyumen regions did their wages increase according to planned indicators and even surpass them a little bit. Of course the overall trend is positive, but if you look at individual regions, dynamics vary a great deal. Thus when comparing October 2012 and October 2011, teachers’ average wage increases range from 2 percent in the Nenets Autonomous Area to 53 percent in Magadan Region, though of course the base indicator was different in Magadan and initially wages there were very low. Nevertheless, we must find a comprehensive solution to this problem. Again, I would repeat that subsequent wage increases must be linked to structural reforms in public sector industries. Today I would like to hear whether federal agencies have developed guidelines to oversee these transformations and whether this information has been passed on to all of Russia’s regions. How and how fast are regions planning to carry out structural reforms and, accordingly, enable the average wages of public sector employees to achieve desired indicators? We need to analyse all these issues in detail and to work on them. We also need to look at regional budget spending in general, and to know precisely what funds have already been allocated for these purposes. The Finance Ministry has such information. The second issue we will discuss today is addressing shortages of preschool facilities. Starting from 2007, the number of children in Russia has been growing every year and, naturally, this is a very good thing. In the first 10 months of this year 7 percent more babies were born compared with the same period in 2011, and in absolute terms this amounts to more than 101,000 babies. Of course this is good. But what does it mean? Regions and municipalities must keep up with this growth, take into account demographic projections, have an adequate number of preschool facilities operating, allocate the required funds for these purposes, support private enterprise and competition in this sector, create the conditions for and promote the development of non-governmental forms of preschool education, and provide for multipurpose use of buildings and facilities when constructing new preschools. Lately, the situation with preschool facilities has improved a bit. However, in some regions this problem remains acute. Together with childbirth, this issue is a crucial one for our country. To this end, the Government is considering further support for the regions in 2013, but in this connection I would like to say the following: naturally we must look at health and safety rules and regulations that are considered too stringent – many experts talk about this, and in the regions I visit governors and local leaders are constantly talking about this too. As I already said, we have to look at various forms of preschool education and to provide support where it is needed. Naturally, not to everyone indiscriminately, but to the regions that need this support the most. I would ask the Finance Ministry to keep a sharp eye on the extent to which the regional budgets are balanced. Any allocation of additional resources while implementing a budget must take into account the actual needs. And if new facilities are being built, we will require a detailed financial feasibility study, design and construction documents. Naturally, it is impossible to build anything without these documents, but the construction is needed. It’s only that everything should be done in a timely fashion. The third topic is relocating people from unfit housing. Together with the regions, the Russian Government must develop corresponding measures by March 2013. At present the total area of housing classified as unfit as of January 1, 2012 amounts to more than 10,000,000 square metres, and it houses more than 650,000 people. Estimates for their relocation total about 364 billion rubles. The federal budget has already provided 159.6 billion rubles for projects overseen by the Housing and Utilities Reform Fund. True, we agreed that some of these funds should be spent on major repairs so there will be less funds to be used for relocating people from unfit housing. According to the Fund, these amounts will allow us to relocate about 300,000 people occupying a total area of approximately 4,500,000 square metres. But we must have a thorough understanding of the situation in the regions, understand whether regional budget funds have been allocated for this purpose, and what other mechanisms may be involved; we must understand and know all this. Let me remind you that we will be resolving these problems together with the regions. The fourth item on our agenda is providing better housing for large families. This issue is complex and progress here is very slow, especially with regards to providing such families with plots of land for individual housing construction and creating the necessary infrastructure. I will not cite any figures but a considerable number of large families (in total Russia has about 966,000 such families), more than 128,000, would like to get a plot of land, but this still poses significant challenges. I propose that we discuss available options to help large families improve their living conditions, and the extent to which regions are willing to provide them with financial and other resources. The next issue is assistance to large families in those regions where the demographic situation is worse than the national average. I stressed this in my pre-election articles, during meetings with relevant officials, and it is also mentioned in my executive orders. To be honest, we have 50 regions with negative demographic trends, most of them located in the Central, Northwestern, Volga and Far Eastern federal districts. The federal budget allocates extra funds to these regions to co-finance their obligations to pay monthly child benefits to families for the third child and subsequent children. I would ask you to report today on whether the regions have made provisions in their budgets to meet these obligations. Colleagues, as I already said, today we need to discuss whether or not our regions are fully integrating the priorities outlined in my executive orders into their budgets. And in connection with this, we must determine which costs must be cut. The issue of regions taking out loans requires continuous monitoring. I would ask the Finance Ministry to report today on the status of that particular problem. In recent years, Russian regions and publicly funded institutions have had more independence to allocate their resources. We have moved away from estimated funding. This is certainly a good policy, but it must be supplemented by mechanisms that allow federal government to effectively monitor whether or not certain desired indicators are being achieved. Incidentally, we gained this experience while working on the national projects and implementing regional programmes to modernise healthcare and education. In those cases, the federal authorities provided targeted subsidies in return for specific commitments. In general, the mechanism proved itself and functioned well. Now we need to adapt and improve these mechanisms in order to achieve a wider range of goals. Let’s talk about all of these issues today. <…>', 'kremlin_id': 17026, 'place': 'Sochi', 'title': 'Meeting on regional budgets', 'teaser': 'Meeting participants discussed the implementation of presidential instructions to achieve specific socio-economic development goals outlined in a number of presidential executive orders issued on May 7, 2012.', 'tags': ['Budget', 'Regions', 'Social services'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Good afternoon, colleagues, A federal budget has been approved, and we recently discussed its priorities with the leaders of parliamentary parties.

            "{'date': '2022-12-07T19:35:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues. First, I would like to congratulate you on the upcoming Human Rights Day. By tradition, our meetings are timed to this event. It directly concerns each of you, as well as the council's experts, consultants, and office staff. Your joint work to protect the rights, freedoms and lawful interests of the people is a continuing operation. For many of you, these multifaceted activities – it would be no exaggeration to describe it like this – have essentially become your destiny, a calling and a life-long mission that inspires others. You are putting your heart into this work, sparing no time and effort to help those who need care and support. I would like to sincerely thank you for this very responsible and noble mission. It is gratifying that you do not relax your activities in the areas that the council continuously keeps in focus. These include education, healthcare, environmental protection, children’s rights and digitisation – there are many questions here. I know you have finished working on the draft concept of the protection of human rights and civil freedoms in the digital space of the Russian Federation and a plan of measures on implementing it. Your interested, persistent participation is also important in resolving problems of providing medications for all categories that need them, but primarily, of course, cancer patients. Both the federal Government and the regional authorities implement the majority of the council’s recommendations. This shows that the analysis of conclusions and expert examinations you suggest has become more thorough. Today, we are planning to discuss the development of legislation on non-profit organisations, ensuring citizens’ rights in the legal process, preservation of the cultural heritage and many other issues. A big bloc concerns the special military operation (SMO). Since the first day, Mr Valery Fadeyev     Fadeyev ValeryAdviser to the President  and the majority of the council members have held an abundantly clear civic position. They have been explaining the true reasons and need for the SMO, countering overt racism and aggressive Russophobia, blatant lies and mean, very mean and sneaky fake stories that are spread by foreign media and other propaganda resources.  Your work on upholding the rights and the truth, the rights of our people, the residents of Donbass, our cultural heritage and traditional values is of great significance. Importantly, you continue exposing the crimes of the Nazi regime that has asserted itself in a neighbouring country. We have emphasized many times that for eight years the rights of the residents of the much-suffering Donbass were completely ignored by the international community, the so-called international community. In the meantime, our council has addressed this issue many times. It sent information to the corresponding international institutions that are called on to ensure, support and promote human rights, but they, at any rate most of them, that are now acting as accusers, pretended to have become blind or deaf all of a sudden. It was only after the start of the SMO that the UN HRC, the Council of Europe and other so-called human rights organisations suddenly “saw the light” and began to shamelessly demonstrate what I would call their cynical bias, and to attempt to shift the blame ‘from a sick head to a healthy one’, as they say in Russia. All this meant that these organisations were unable to perform their chartered tasks. Due to their obvious bias, Russia has had to cancel its membership in a number of them. I believe that our council, as an institution dealing with a broad range of public organisations in Russia and abroad, could become an efficient international platform for discussing human rights issues and the protection of these rights in the modern world. The existing approaches require a comprehensive analysis because they are being used to achieve quite different goals, far from constructive ones. Thus, we are seeing that human rights doctrines are being used to destroy the sovereignty of states and justify Western political, financial, economic and ideological dominance.  Colleagues, I would like to thank you for your active assistance to our citizens living on the new territories. Some of you have become a true voice of the people there. Thus, journalist Marina Akhmedova has worked in Donbass since 2014. With the start of the SMO, she has visited the frontlines more than once, I know this, and organized humanitarian aid to the residents of liberated Mariupol and Volnovakha.  I would like to note that this year the membership of the council has changed significantly. It includes well-known people, such public opinion leaders as Yelena Shishkina, member of the Presidium of the Free Donbass public movement, and Olga Demicheva who heads the Doctor Liza’s Fair Aid Charity.  This organisation – we know it well – provides treatment for critically ill children from Donbass and helps the evacuated. At one time, Doctor Liza – Yelizaveta Glinka – was the first to raise this issue at council meetings. She was also the first to take these Donbass children for treatment, literally during shelling, to put it straight. I hope your experience and knowledge will be helpful for our new territories in developing civil society institutions and a modern non-commercial sector. I consider it important for the new council to continue contributing to the tasks facing the country and society, to work persistently and boldly, to raise problems that concern people and to resolve them in cooperation with the authorities.  These times are really not easy, and your opinions, positions, public speeches and statements must certainly be verified. They must work to unite our society. In fact, this is what is taking place now. Let us start our work, please. Mr Fadeyev, you have the floor, please. Chair of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights Valery Fadeyev     Fadeyev ValeryAdviser to the President : Thank you, Mr President. Mr President, colleagues, The council has been focusing on the main and most complicated circumstances in the country. The special military operation. Many council members have repeatedly visited the SMO zone, and you, Mr President, have just mentioned this. Our colleagues are working with refugees in the Russian regions. The council has established working interaction with the authorities and civil organisations in the new regions of Russia. Today, council members will share their impressions with us. Both before and especially after the accession of the new regions to Russia, the council recorded evidence of crimes committed by the Kiev regime as regards civilians. The council is sending relevant notices to over 1,800 addresses – international human rights organisations, European parliament deputies, and editors of leading Western media. As of today, they have recorded 4,334 VSU (Armed Forces of Ukraine) shells and rockets in Donetsk, Ilovaisk, Gorlovka, Makeyevka, Rubezhnoye, Svatov and other residential areas. This shelling was not part of the hostilities. It was targeted not at military facilities but at civilians, residential buildings, schools and hospitals. In autumn, we sent information to human rights organisations about harassment of civilians in the Kharkov Region, executions in Kupyansk, the shelling of a crossing in Kherson, and executions of Russian POWs, and we have not received an adequate response so far. There are some letters from the Vatican, the Red Cross, and some European parliament deputies, but international human rights organisations remain silent. The lack of response shows that international human rights institutions are politicised and biased and that actually they are not performing their functions. The Western community renounced any defence of the rights of Donbass residents in 2014, but the urgency of this problem has become even more obvious with the start of the SMO. Our council will continue seeking the fulfilment of their charter tasks by the UN Human Rights Council, the Council of Europe and other international institutions. However, at the same time we have launched an international dialogue on the need to modernise and reform these institutions. At the Petersburg Judicial Forum in June of this year, we held the first roundtable discussion on this issue. Despite the statements by our German partners about their intention to discontinue the work of the Petersburg Dialogue Forum, we are trying to preserve these contacts. We have just held a conference in Yaroslavl, in November, on humanism and human rights, together with our German colleagues, as well as representatives of China, Argentina, Uzbekistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Iran.  Next year will be 75 years since the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is a fundamental document. It was important for building the postwar world order. However, now the West often uses it to impose its values. New Western values that are in vogue have been brought to the point of absurdity. They are simply destructive. They will hardly be accepted in other parts of the world but they can do much harm. The source of these values is not accidental. The Western concept of rights and freedoms is based on the understanding of a person as an autonomous individual. But individualism is not the main value for many peoples and civilisations, for most of them. National models must take into account religious, historical and cultural peculiarities. At one time, conceptual regional human rights documents were created, for instance, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. Note the word “peoples.” The charter deals with sovereignty, the freedom of peoples from external oppression – Africans have not forgotten colonial times. There was the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam. It codified, in part, a certain view on family values and these are, of course, traditional family values. However, instead of welcoming this approach, this diversity – democratic diversity – Western political institutions are ignoring these documents. The West is demonstrating its scorn for the countries of the so-called Third World even though the bigger part of the world population lives there. It is necessary to seek genuine universality, to seek what unites people rather than separates them. All participants in this work must enjoy complete equality. Mr President, I would like to ask you to support our joint effort with the Foreign Ministry in this area, in part, on the sidelines of the BRICS and the SCO summits. I have already held preliminary consultations with the Foreign Ministry, with Sergey Lavrov. Partial mobilisation. At the beginning of the partial mobilisation, there was confusion within military enlistment offices. In the very first days, the council outlined the problems and demanded strict adherence to mobilisation rules. Thus, citizens were mobilised not in accordance with the Executive Order and Law on Mobilisation. Fulfilment of certain plans cannot justify violations of the law. Mistakes were corrected, including individual mobilization cases. In October, the council drafted a report on implementing the Executive Order on Partial Mobilisation. We received a detailed reply from the Defence Ministry and the relevant State Duma Committee on each item. The council retains control over all of these issues. Legal gaps were revealed. The council looked into the ambiguous opportunity for alternative civilian service under mobilisation. In November, this ambiguity was removed. There were complaints about the remuneration of mobilized personnel – there was a considerable difference in the amount of payments depending on the region of the Russian Federation. Mr President, you corrected this situation with your decision. However, our colleagues are reporting, including our new council member Alexander Kots, that nothing was deposited on the accounts of some people for four months, and some others did not receive their regional supplements. This is not a mass phenomenon, but it is necessary to deal with these things on a case-by-case basis. There were quite a few cases where gear was overpriced – both when mobilised personnel bought it themselves and when the regional authorities bought it on a large scale. In general, this problem was resolved as well – the interested government institutions acted promptly. That said, some units still face problems with providing mobilised personnel with winter gear. Currently, our focus is shifting to the families of our military personnel. A nonformal approach with a human touch is very important in these efforts. I have no doubt that the new members of the Council – Yulia Belekhova, Head of the Committee for the Families of the Soldiers of the Fatherland; Yelena Shishkina from the Free Donbass public movement; Olga Demicheva representing Doctor Liza’s Fair Aid Charity; the Children’s Rights Ombudsman [for the Ulyanovsk Region], Yekaterina Smoroda and others – will be actively involved in these efforts. They are already seriously engaged in this work.  Now I want to brief you on several other areas of our work.  Digitalisation. Mr President, on your instructions, the council jointly with the Government has developed a concept for protecting human rights and freedoms in the digital space, and work is underway to prepare a draft executive order on this concept. However, already now, without waiting for approval of this concept, several measures could be taken to protect people’s personal data. My colleague Kirill Kabanov will provide more details on this issue.  The law on probation. The council traditionally pays attention to the conditions created for inmates in penitentiaries. The council and the Ministry of Justice have developed a draft law on probation. We are studying the positive experience of re-socialising convicts by involving them in work through penitentiary centres. One positive example is in the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Area – Yugra; we went there to study their experience.  The memory of the victims of political repression. The council continues to take part in implementing the Concept of the Government Policy of Perpetuating the Memory of the Victims of Political Repression. Last November, an interdepartmental working group held a meeting in Tomsk: the NKVD Detention Prison Memorial Museum opened in the city. We continue to work with the Moscow and Moscow Region authorities to create a museum on the Butovo memorial site.  My colleagues will talk about other problems and the council’s efforts to help resolve them.  My report is finished. Thank you for your attention. Vladimir Putin: Mr Fadeyev, thank you very much. You noted several things, I will not comment on all of them.  As for the problem with military gear, it seems to have already been resolved. Nonetheless, if anything requires special attention, please give me more information and we will sort things out as soon as possible.  A second important topic is providing support to the families of the mobilised people. Of course, this should be a matter of concern for everyone, and the state and I, of course, am counting on your support and your assistance in this work in the regions. This is the sacred responsibility of all authorities at every level, as well as of civic organisations. Of course, this involves several issues from the timely payment of salaries to simply offering help with household chores that many families of mobilised men need. So, I strongly hope these efforts will be cooperative and effective.  As for perpetrating the memory of the victims of political repression, we should not forget by any means about this work. This is a complicated and hard page in our history. History is what it is and nothing should be hidden; I have spoken about this many times. But nothing should be allowed to be used as a tool in a struggle against Russia in general, and today, in particular. However, in objectively appraising everything that is part of our history, we must respond appropriately, including where the efforts to perpetuate the memory of the victims of political repression are concerned.  I fully agree with you. Vladimir Putin (commenting on the speech by REGNUM news agency editor-in-chief Marina Akhmedova on the shelling of civilians in Donbass and the assistance to wounded soldiers in rehabilitation and prosthetic treatment): I will start with what you began with and will answer point by point. You spoke about the shelling of Donbass and the cities of Donbass and the lack of reaction from certain and even almost all our – we should put it in quotation marks – ‘Western partners.’ These human rights organisations – as we have finally seen for ourselves – were created not as a tool to protect human rights, but as an instrument of influencing the domestic policy of Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. Yes, there are various human rights organisations in the West, but they were mainly created for this purpose. In order to look neutral, they spoke about human rights in their own countries from time to time, but it was an exception. They were mostly in charge of professional work in the Russian and post-Soviet space, this was obvious. This is the first point. Second, the fact that they have been turning a blind eye to the tragedy in Donbass over the past eight years is the best confirmation to what I, Mr Fadeyev and you have said. As for the shelling of Donbass cities, you mentioned that your colleague was killed there. Yesterday, Head of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin telephoned me. It is true, residential neighbourhoods are being shelled. It is impossible that they do not know about it. Everyone is silent as if nothing was happening there. This is horrible. You said that people in Donbass are treated like second-rate people. You know, I would like to say in this relation: to those who are engaged in protecting human rights – and I just said why, in my opinion, the so-called human rights organisations in the West were created – to them, people mean nothing. They do not really consider these people second-rate; they consider Russia to be a second-rate country that does not have the right to exist. This is the problem and a disaster. This is what we are dealing with right now. We have been dealing with it throughout our history, and it is especially obvious now. We will proceed from the current reality. There can be only one answer from us: Russia will consistently fight for its national interests. This is what we will do, and let nobody believe otherwise. Yes, we will do it using various means and ways, first of all, of course, focusing on peaceful means. But if we have no choice, we will defend ourselves with everything we have. With regard to demobilising students in Donbass, indeed, these territories, these republics became part of Russia, so Russian legal regulations should apply to them in full. It is not so straightforward, and is rather a lengthy process that requires a transition period, but there are things that must be done right now, and demobilising students is one such thing. Truth be told, not all Donbass students took advantage of their right to demobilise. Literally a day ago, I had a meeting with volunteers – perhaps, you took note of it. The winner of the competition is a resident of Donetsk. I had a brief conversation with him after the meeting, and he said that this news was very positively received in Donetsk and Donbass in general, but he knows people, his comrades, who chose not to be demobilised and continue to take part in combat action. We should definitely look into demobilising some specialists, including medical doctors and prosthetists. But we need to approach matters of support and assistance more seriously. As you may be aware, I met with the mothers of the servicemen who are taking part in the special military operation, and some of them brought up questions of helping wounded and disabled soldiers. What we need to do in this regard is to arrange for up-to-date prosthetics production, to expand the capabilities of specialised enterprises and companies, since we already have them in place. Time has come to expand their operations. This is the first point. Second, we need to upgrade the equipment and to provide medications to everyone in need. It is necessary to put a rehabilitation system in place and cover travel expenses to the place of rehabilitation and back, because a wounded person, especially a person with a disability, will find it difficult or even impossible to get to a place of rehabilitation on their own. This issue needs to be addressed in a number of ways. I think we will need to create a special centre within the Government’s social block that will deal with these matters. Also, this kind of work must be done at the level of deputy governors in charge of social issues in all regions. Next, a support system for the people who need state help must be put in place. All of that must be done as soon as possible. We will definitely see to it. Thank you for raising this issue. The Government will receive corresponding instructions literally today or tomorrow. Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin (responding to Commissioner for Human Rights in the Sverdlovsk Region Tatyana Merzlyakova, who shared information about her trip to the special military operation zone, discussed the SMO zone problems, and asked the President about the likelihood of another mobilisation wave): Ms Merzlyakova, first of all I would like to thank you for what you are doing. Your work is extremely important. This kind of work is important at all times, but it is particularly important in the current circumstances. I am not going to share my assessments of those who, as you said, left the country during the mobilisation drive. It is a separate issue, and we can talk about it at length. You said it was ”not their life.” It may well be that some of them even think that this is not their country. But, again, I would leave it at that. As for the issues in the special military operation zone, they certainly existed. They are probably still there. And they can arise anytime and anywhere in the operation zone. It is important to keep an eye on these matters, to constantly analyse the unfolding developments and have feedback. This is beyond doubt. Everyone needs this, including our men on the frontline, society, and the state, because that would improve the quality and efficiency of our combat work. About leaving positions. You are aware that soldiers who try to do that in Ukraine are shot on the spot. More than that, they even conduct mass executions in public, in front of the troops. This is common knowledge. We do not practice anything of the kind, and we do not even have any, as you said, camps or incarceration facilities, or the like. This is all nonsense and fake claims and there is nothing to back them up with. Here is what I would like to say in this regard. Are there soldiers out there who have left their combat positions? Yes, it has happened. Less and less now. What is the problem? After all, a person who finds himself in a war zone – even after certain training – cannot avoid experiencing certain feelings, which is absolutely normal. The vast majority of these people return to combat duty of their own accord. The vast majority do so, even after recovering from wounds. Why? Because there is a period of adaptation to the circumstances in which they perform their military duties. To reiterate, we do not see this happening in mass proportions. All you need to do is work with people. What we need here is delicate, calm, and balanced case-by-case work with each individual. Overall, people from the Defence Ministry who are doing this professionally are getting better at it. We do not have any problems with soldiers leaving combat positions. There is no such problem as desertion in the zone of the special military operation. Yes, there have been such cases and we should not shut our eyes to them. I have already explained and said frankly what it is about. In a situation when there is shelling or bombs falling, all normal people cannot help but react to it, even on the physiological level. But after a certain adaptation period, our men fight brilliantly. I have repeatedly said that they are true heroes and deserve, as you said, to be treated as such after they fulfil their military duty and upon their arrival from the combat zone. It is absolutely obvious. The country and society, including public organisations, must create the right environment and conditions for these guys. I have already said it and want to reiterate: this also applies to the support and assistance to the families of our military personnel. We must treat them, as you said and I wrote down, as the defenders of the Motherland. This is the environment that must be created for them. Now about the possible mobilisation and the rumours surrounding it. Look, we have mobilised 300,000 people, our men, our defenders of the Fatherland. Half of them, 150,000 men, are located in the zone of the special military operation; these 150,000, half of all those mobilised, are in the troops. Of those, 77,000, only half, are members of tactical units. The rest of them are at the second and third frontiers and perform the functions of territorial defence, or undergoing training in the operation zone. Another 150,000, that is, the second half of all those mobilised, are still at the Defence Ministry testing grounds and training centres where they are undergoing additional training. They are the combat reserve, if we can call them that. These are half of those mobilised, 150,000. In this regard, talk of extending mobilisation does not make sense, and there is no need for it either for the state or the Ministry of Defence at this time. This is what I wanted to say in response to your question. (Yevgeny Myslovsky, Honourary President of the Anti-Mafia Regional Public Foundation to Combat Organised Crime and Corruption, began his remarks with the statement that “people are expecting results.” He drew attention to the following aspect of the special military operation: the investigation of war crimes by the enemy and the political significance of this investigation. He noted than over 10,000 peaceful civilians had been killed in Donetsk alone. Mr Myslovsky suggested establishing a state commission to investigate these crimes. He also discussed the deployment of law enforcement officers in the newly incorporated territories. For example, he suggested involving experienced veterans.)  Vladimir Putin: Mr Myslovsky, did you mean the results of the special military operation when you said that everyone is expecting results?  Yevgeny Myslovsky: No, I did not mean the special military operation because this is a lengthy process. I meant specific results following the investigation of criminal cases. People say that we are investigating, but that only one verdict has been passed. Vladimir Putin: I see.  Regarding the lengthy process and the results of the special military operation, this process could be drawn out. You also noted that newly incorporated territories have appeared. Indeed, this is a significant result for Russia, and this is a serious issue. To be honest, the Sea of Azov has become an inland sea in the Russian Federation, and these are serious things. Yevgeny Myslovsky: This is all correct, but we need to develop this. Vladimir Putin: Yes, but this is a different issue. In his time, Peter the Great fought to reach the Sea of Azov.  The people living on these territories are the most important thing. The results of the referendum show that people want to live in Russia, and that they consider themselves part of this world, this space, our common culture, traditions and language. This is the most important result, and these millions of people have re-joined us. This is the most important thing.  Regarding criminal investigations, you are right, of course, but to be frank, all of us understand the realities of current developments. It is important to investigate, to record these crimes, especially strikes against civilian and residential areas. You are probably right: perhaps it would be appropriate to set up some joint agency that would address this issue and a state commission. Let us think about this. I will also ask the Prosecutor-General’s Office and the Investigative Committee to think about this issue. They should consider recruiting veteran law enforcement officers who would like to deal with this issue as mentors or as officials who can look into the available materials. I will instruct the Prosecutor-General’s Office to do this, and we will certainly think about this issue. I completely agree with you that it is necessary to record all this in a professional manner. Vladimir Putin (commenting on the questions raised in a speech by Doctor of Medical Sciences Yan Vlasov, co-chairman of the Russian Patient Association. These questions concerned, first, doctors’ salaries and raising their professional status, as well as the lack of specialists in field medicine, and the supply of medicines and consumables to the special military operation.): Thank you for the questions raised. They are all important, all of them, without exaggeration.  I will start with the question you ended your speech with, training specialists, especially for field surgery and field medical activities. Of course, the Defence Ministry believes it is doing well in general. Nevertheless, I will talk to the Ministry’s leaders and the Minister himself about the issues that you raised, and if something needs to be done, I will encourage my colleagues from the Defence Ministry to do it and ensure that it is done. This is the first thing. The second. Regarding the use of consumables, including those that, as you say, may be sitting in company warehouses, especially if they have not yet expired. Of course, we should deal with this issue, and I will definitely tell not only the Defence Minister, but also the Health Minister and Ms Golikova about this. They have the whole site in front of their eyes; let us find out what can be used and how. We will definitely do this. Especially if something is missing. Now, regarding the improvement of the medical education system as a whole. I think it is quite serious and thorough. Probably, in modern conditions, in the modern world, everything needs constant attention and constant improvement, this goes without saying, because life is developing at a very fast pace, and new opportunities, technological opportunities are emerging. We constantly talk about this, and this is constantly in the field of vision of the Health Ministry. If you think that something more needs to be done, additional steps should be taken, including the connection between medical practice and theoretical skills, then, of course, I would ask you to present your considerations in a specific form. I promise you that I will issue this as an instruction to both the Ministry of Health and the Government as a whole, and my colleagues will definitely work it out. Regarding training and re-training, the Ministry of Health has built an advanced training system. Mr Vlasov, again, if you see that something is not organised here the way it should be, or you have specific proposals on how to fix things or to improve this work, I would be grateful to you if you could submit an outline that can be used to draft a presidential instruction to the Government. We will do this by all means. It may well be that some professors are detached from reality and from clinical practice. But I know a lot of doctors who teach and engage in practical work and perform surgeries. I am sure you are aware of this; there are many specialists like that. They deserve praise and God bless them. Without a doubt, they need support in order to create and expand their own schools. Now, regarding what you started with, salaries. I agree that the remuneration system absolutely needs to be improved, especially in primary care. The Government was tasked with developing common approaches to all regions nationwide to make sure basic principles of remuneration were properly lined up. I completely agree. Of course, subsistence levels vary across regions. I mean that the cost of living varies and salaries are different, not only in public health, but in other areas as well. This must be taken into account, but in general it is important to make sure that the experiment to level incomes in the healthcare system that the Government has begun to carry out is not forgotten. This is for the future. I must agree with you that it is important to take steps to support medical workers now, without delay. In this regard, I instructed the Government to draft corresponding proposals. I would like to inform you that we have agreed – and I supported these proposals by the Government – we need to start from primary care and up. Starting January next year, I asked the Government to start making additional payments to primary care medical staff in central district hospitals, district hospitals and in the EMS system. The additional payments will range from 4,500 to 18,500 rubles depending on the position and job description. I asked the Government to start accruing these payments from January 1, 2023. If it takes some time to cut through the bureaucracy, then probably they will not be able to do it from January 1, since we are almost in the middle of December, but all the same, the technical issues should be resolved in the first quarter, and the extra payments should be calculated retroactively, from January 1, 2023. (Kirill Vyshinsky, Executive Director of the Rossiya Segodnya International Information Agency, was the next to speak. He spent a year in a Ukrainian prison for his activities as a journalist. In his remarks, he spoke about a wave of Russophobia, primarily in Europe, and cited many specific examples. In his opinion, it is time to assess this phenomenon politically and legally. He believes it is worth either supplementing a relevant article or introducing a new article on Russophobia to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. He said this phenomenon should be classified in legal terms and liability for it should be determined.)  Vladimir Putin: Mr Vyshinsky, with your permission I will use your remarks to re-emphasise one idea. The point is that we did not start the war – you know this better than anyone else. It was started in 2014 after the state coup in Ukraine. It was started at that time by the Ukrainian authorities that came into the corridors of power with the help of this state coup for suppressing the will of the people living in Donbass.  At that time, also in 2014, three foreign ministers – of Poland, Germany and France – came to Kiev and signed a conciliatory document between the then government in Ukraine and the opposition. They signed it as guarantors of peaceful developments. After the state coup was staged, these guarantors forgot that they were guarantors. What were they supposed to do as guarantors? They were supposed to return everything to the legal field and urge everyone to attend general elections and resolve this domestic political crisis by peaceful means. But no, nothing like this was done. Everyone seemed to have forgotten all about this document. When I remind my colleagues about it, including in telephone conversations, they are all silent – they have nothing to say. After this, hostilities began in Donbass with the use of heavy equipment, heavy weapons and aviation. This was when some European and North American countries could have developed not Russophobic but other phobic attitudes towards those who used force against civilians, against the civilian population. However, nothing of the kind happened. But what was happening all these years? The lawful interests of the people who lived there and the lawful interests of Russia to protect them were ignored. We only got spat in the face in response to all our demands. This is exactly a covert form of Russophobia. Unfortunately, it has always been present in some Western circles and our neighbours – I am referring to the nationalist circles of Ukraine. It has always been there and you talk about this very vividly. Sometimes I have time, either by chance or otherwise, but sometimes I watch your programmes. They are very convincing and profound, and I would like to thank you especially for this. Strictly speaking, this is precisely about ignoring our interests, the interests of the people who live in this land. This is Russophobia. They turned everything upside down and do not admit that they failed to fulfill their obligations as guarantors of the agreement between the government and the opposition in Ukraine in 2014. They do not admit that they trampled on these agreements or that the Ukrainian authorities who took power as a result of a coup started these hostilities. They do not talk about the killing of civilians in Donbass. They do not say anything. They only got involved when the special military operation began. And it started only because we were left with no way to resolve the situation peacefully. Leaving things the way they were was absolutely not an option. However, it was used as a pretext for fomenting anti-Russia sentiment. There is nothing surprising here from the point of view of history. Russia has often been confronted with situations like this. With regard to the authorities of some of our neighbouring countries, Poland in this case, you are aware of it as a former resident of Ukraine. Polish nationalists are bent on returning their so-called historical territories, that is, taking back the western territories that Ukraine received as a result of Joseph Stalin’s decision following WWII. As you may be aware, these territories were taken from Poland and given to Soviet Ukraine. Of course, the nationalist elements in Poland are determined to take these territories back, and they will strive to make it happen no matter who says what. We see this even in their literature, their reasoning and public speeches. This is what they will eventually try to do; I have no doubt about it. I have said it before, but I want to say it again: Russia could be the only real guarantor of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty within its current borders. Russia was instrumental in Ukraine obtaining these territories after the World War II. Under Stalin's policy, of course. But it is up to the Ukrainian politicians of the future to decide on this. In my opinion, current politicians understand little about it and are not thinking about it. Although some appear to have begun to think about this. Any kind of active involvement by Ukraine’s Western ally or neighbour in Ukrainian affairs will ultimately be aimed at taking parts of western Ukraine. One can only wish they thought about it and realised what is going on. Well, again, it is up to them to decide. I agree with your proposal. Let us work it through, and thank you for wording it that way. We cannot be surprised by isolated elements of Russophobia, including influence on children. We are aware of the fact that in some Western countries, zoo animals are killed, cut up and so on, in front of children. This is something that is absolutely not our culture, the culture of the peoples of the Russian Federation, not only the Russian people, but other ethnicities as well. But these things happen there. They work with the minds of the public in brutal ways. May God be their judge, but I think this will turn against them sooner or later. (Remarks by director of the GRANI Centre for Civic Analysis and Independent Research Foundation Svetlana Makovetskaya, an expert in Russian civil society institutions’ performance, including with regard to legal issues, covered the problems of institutional building of non-profit organisations. Svetlana Makovetskaya highlighted contradictions between the basic legislation on non-profit activities and the Civil Code and asked the President to instruct the Government together with the Presidential Council for Human Rights and expert organisations specialising in NGO experience to identify a single approach to further legislative progress in the non-profit sector. However, at the end of her remarks, Svetlana Makovetskaya turned to an issue which she believes to be of concern for a great number of people in the country, namely, the fact that at present the threat of nuclear war appears real.) Vladimir Putin: I see.  Concerning the threat of nuclear war. Ms Makovetskaya, you are right, the threat is growing, to be honest.  Regarding Russia never using [nuclear weapons] first under any circumstances. Well, if it does not use them first, then it will not be the second to use them either, because in the case of a nuclear strike at our territory, our capabilities will be significantly limited.  Nevertheless, our strategy of using means of defence – and we view weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons as a defence – is entirely centred around the so-called retaliatory strike, that is, we strike back when we are attacked. There are also tactical nuclear weapons, much talked about recently. The US has large stockpiles of nuclear weapons in Europe. We have never given anyone our nuclear weapons but it is natural that we will defend our allies with all means at our disposal, if needed.  What is the issue here? The point is that as much as in the previous case, when we talked about Russophobia, nobody takes notice nor wants to notice and see what is being done and talked about in the neighbouring countries, in Western countries. I reiterate that we do not deploy or have our nuclear weapons in other countries including tactical weapons, whereas the Americans do – in Turkey and a number of other European nations. They conduct drills on the possible use of these countries’ carriers for American nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, we have never done this so far. This is point number two.  Number three. Have we ever spoken about the possibility of their use? No, we have not. Whereas the former UK Prime Minister, God forgive her, said publicly that she was ready to do that. In response, I had to highlight some issues. Her statement was disregarded by everyone whereas whatever we say is immediately overemphasised, and our statements are used to scare the world.  Therefore, we have not lost our minds, we are well aware of what nuclear weapons are. We have them, and they are in a more advanced and up-to-date condition that the weapons in the possession of any other nuclear power. It is obvious, it is an obvious fact today. Yet we are not going to wield these weapons like a razor running around the globe. However, we proceed from the fact that we have them. This is a natural deterrent which does not provoke an escalation of conflicts but is rather a deterring factor. I hope everyone understands this. And now regarding your proposals on improving legal regulation and the legal base for non-profit organisations. I would like to note first that activities of non-profit organisations are vital for our country because – I have spoken about it many times, and I say absolutely sincerely that non-profit organisations are often more efficient in matters where decent, well-trained and sincere officials work hard to get the best result in their work. I mean that NGOs do not operate for money, they primarily work answering the call of the heart, and such motivation to help people, to achieve results in utterly crucial and sensitive social areas is extremely important for the end result.  Therefore, we are interested in laying an effective legal foundation. I will pass on all of your proposals – I take it you have them ready – to the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry will probably start with analysing them with the Legal Directorate of the Presidential Executive Office. I will definitely issue such an instruction and I ask you to hand over your proposals and suggestions to Mr Fadeyev. You are obviously right: it should be done together with the Government, the Human Rights Council and experts like you. (In his remarks, Chairman of the National Anti-Corruption Committee public organisation Kirill Kabanov raised issues of human rights protection in the digital space. He spoke about personal data leaks from different digital platforms, the leaks which may entail quite concrete negative repercussions for citizens, and about fraud and theft of money. Kirill Kabanov thinks it necessary to set turnover-based fines for companies which allow for leaks of personal data to happen, and also to criminalise illegal turnover of personal data. He also believes that there must be a mechanism for retrieving money stolen by criminals, because the state, including law enforcement agencies, responds to such and similar threats ineffectively and too slowly. Kirill Kabanov asked the President to issue instructions on this issue to the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, the Interior Ministry and the Central Bank.) Vladimir Putin: It is undoubtedly a very urgent issue, you must have heard me talk about it when we discuss the development of modern technologies, artificial intelligence and so on, because many of them are impossible to use, impossible to apply without such data, including personal data. The question is, of course, how to protect this data. It is clearly one of the key questions for progressing on this track which is crucial for the development of the economy and social sphere.  However, as of yet, not everything – I absolutely agree with you, Kirill – has been regulated and, and more regulations are needed. Also, penalties for violations in this sphere should probably be toughened. Regarding turnover-based fines and criminal liability. As I understood you, you were talking about criminal liability for illegal turnover. But those who use data must know and realise that they are using stolen data, that is certain, because even a good-faith buyer, a bona fide buyer of stolen property, does not know that the property was stolen. The same applies here. Of course, this must be thoroughly considered. But overall, you are absolutely right, this must be scrutinised and prompt balanced decisions must be taken which will at the same time protect citizens’ rights and will not hamper the development of information technologies which are vital for the state. Turnover-based fines or something of this kind must certainly be given consideration. There is good reason you mentioned turnover-based fines because for some companies these may be huge, and it is definitely a serious matter. Nevertheless, let me stress again that you are right and corresponding decisions to protect citizens must be worked out and taken. As to the recovery of assets lost by citizens due to fraud with the use of cutting-edge technologies, there are certain problems here since oftentimes such assets are stolen or people are swindled in such ways and with such means, including with the use of modern technologies, that a person seems to have given something or signed something of their free will. There is a fine line here of responsibility for what is going on. But however fine it may be, it is still there, and in such cases they are fraudulent actions which hurt citizens and violate their rights.  We know that most banks compensate such losses to citizens in most cases. But you are also right in saying that there must a certain system in place, a common approach to solving such issues. Today, most financial organisations set aside approximate amounts to compensate citizens their lost assets. However, these matters should be considered and systemised, therefore I agree with you. Respective instructions will be given to the Ministry of Digital Development, the Interior Ministry and the Central Bank. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: (commenting on remarks by Moskovsky Komsomolets columnist and human rights activist Yeva Merkacheva, who spoke about conditions in pre-trial detention centres for women who have children, on excessively long pre-trial detention before a verdict is brought in, quoting a number of such cases she has knowledge of. Yeva Merkacheva also asked the President to voice his position on bringing back capital punishment since, according to her, many officials have expressed their support for this idea.) Regarding the death sentence. a short while ago Chairman of the Constitutional Court Valery Zorkin spoke about it at the congress of judges. Responding to those who favour the return of capital punishment, he said we would have to change our Constitution to do that. That is why my position has not changed in this regard. This is the first point. Second, concerning what you started with: women with children and everything related to them, to arrests etc. Ms Merkacheva, you then proceeded with other categories, and this is quite right. Why? Because as soon as you mentioned women with children, honestly, we feel pity for women behind bars, and even more so for the children who were left without their mothers, this is obvious. But we also have other categories of people, of course. Just women without children, are they any worse? Or people with disabilities? There are social justice issues, and we need a uniform treatment of all those categories of citizens. This is the first point.  Second, it is quite obvious that if a person spends five years behind bars in the pre-trial detention centre waiting for the trial, it is an obvious violation of human rights. We have talked about it repeatedly, and I told the leadership of the Investigative Committee, the Interior Ministry and other law enforcement agencies that such practices must be terminated. There must be deadlines for investigating any criminal case; cases must not drag on indefinitely citing insurmountable objective difficulties. And if an investigation of a case is not completed by the deadline – true, there are some very complicated cases – then either the case must be dropped or at least the suspect must be released without applying other pre-trial restrictions. There are many different situations in life, Unfortunately, women with children are sometimes used by drug dealers, say, for stashing drugs and so on. There are many real-life situations. Therefore, we must strive to avoid extremes and to have a generally just court and law enforcement system. That is what we must be striving for.  I will definitely issue instructions both to the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Interior Ministry, and I will ask the Supreme Court to analyse practices of this kind.  Concerning the fact that some people are taken to interrogation in handcuffs, especially in cases involving economic crimes, I have no words to characterise it. But I promise you that we will not only focus our attention on that but we will make sure that this practice is definitely stopped.  Will you please write your proposals down on paper and submit them. We will certainly work on that. As I said, I will ask both the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Supreme Court to thoroughly analyse all these issues, and the Investigative Committee, too.  (Olga Demicheva, President of the International Charitable NGO Doctor Liza’s Fair Care, who recently returned from Donbass, said that doctors from the Republican Trauma Centre in Donetsk asked her to tell the President of Russia that they are working, that they will continue to work, that they have considered themselves Russian citizens since 2014. They work under constant shelling, with power cuts, no water, often in cold rooms. They go to work in the morning and do not know if they will return home alive. And yet they do not ask for anything. Ms Demicheva stressed that those people who have been in the Donetsk and Luhansk republics since 2014, who made their choice and who stayed there to live and work, are special people, they are Russia's special value. Olga Demicheva spoke about the most pressing problems facing Donbass in providing medical care during the transition period. For example, before the special military operation started, humanitarian missions of the World Health Organisation, which entered the territory of the DPR and LPR, provided these republics with diagnostic tests, preventive medicine, medications to treat tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis C and so on. Now they have left, and the chief doctors of the relevant clinics say that these resources are now insufficient and it is necessary to close this gap. Olga Demicheva also spoke about the assistance needed by Russian non-profit organisations that are now helping Donbass. In addition, she noted that over almost nine years a wealth of experience in treating mine-blast injuries has been accumulated in Donbass and Russian surgeons and traumatologists need to make use of it). Vladimir Putin: First of all, thank you for continuing the work that was started by Elizaveta Glinka [Dr Lisa]. But the issues are certainly no less urgent, maybe even more acute, compared to the period when your predecessor was heroically engaged in this work. Regarding the doctors in Donbass. Yes, of course, they have great, serious experience in treating certain patients, especially with mine blast injuries and so on, and we should use this. But at the same time, it is clear that they need to be retrained, to get more knowledge, to gain experience with modern equipment, which needs to be provided there. Of course, for the most part, doctors, especially those who work in such difficult conditions, are a special kind of people, with a special character and special, noble motivation. They are not asking for anything, but of course, they must soon fully enter our legal field, the field of social protection, salary levels and so on. All of this, of course, must be done, and we have spoken about it many times. I have talked repeatedly with both the Healthcare Minister and Ms Golikova, who as Deputy Prime Minister oversees this sector. And the relevant plans for work with our colleagues in the new territories are now being finalised and will be implemented. And now, as you know, work is already underway. Unfortunately, one of their Russian colleagues has just died in one of these territories. It is tragic: it happened as a result of a car accident; the driver could not negotiate a slippery road. But she was there for a reason, not on a tourist trip. She was assisting the local doctors in rendering medical aid, first of all to children, checkups for children. She had been working there for quite a long time. This ongoing work needs to become systematic. You are absolutely right, thank you for pointing this out, and especially for saying that we need medications for treating socially significant diseases, meaning HIV, tuberculosis, and so on, which used to come from various organisations. Yes, many of them are apparently gone, and this niche needs to be filled as soon as possible, if indeed it has appeared. Judging by what you say, this niche exists. And we will certainly deal with it now, we will by all means. As for the conditions in which people live and work, this is also an answer to the topic we have just discussed with your colleagues. You mentioned the lack of water in proper quantity and of proper quality. It is the water supply facilities that are controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces that are preventing this water from reaching the million-strong city. This is genocide, this is just a continuation of genocide. No one is paying attention to this, no one. And this is further proof that we are doing everything right. We simply have no choice; we cannot act in any other way. But in carrying out the special military operation, we certainly have to address current issues, and above all social issues, to support, including, in this case, medical workers in all the areas I have mentioned. We will certainly do it. Thank you for your attention to these matters, and thank you for continuing, I want to emphasise it again, what your heroic predecessor did. Thank you very much. (In his statement, Shota Gorgadze, Managing Partner of Gorgadze & Partners Law Firm, touched on the narrow professional issue of protecting the rights of people who have been declared by a court to be either of limited legal capacity or deprived of such. He stressed the need for a lawyer to be involved in such cases, including by appointment, with the possibility of this lawyer being paid from the budget. He asked the President to recommend to the State Duma that they amend the civil procedure accordingly. However, Mr Gorgadze went on to raise an issue that, in his words, worries any reasonable Russian citizen. It is not just rabid Russophobia, attempts to turn the image of a Russian into an enemy, but also attempts to ban Russian culture. For example, Mr Gorgadze mentioned the scandal at the opera house of La Scala with the season opening with Musorgsky's opera ”Boris Godunov.“ The Ukrainian ambassador to Italy protested against this. Mr Gorgadze said that Russian culture, which has become part of world culture and which some rather foolish people are now trying to remove from the world's treasury, requires protection.) Vladimir Putin: Mr Gorgadze, the first thing is to restore the legal standing of those of our citizens who have been declared incapacitated. Of course, I will instruct the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection and other relevant agencies to think about this and propose solutions. This is not about money. Probably, not that much budget money will be required – how many such appeals could there be? This mandatory participation of a lawyer by order of the state and at the expense of the state, this practice is widely used, and court appointed lawyers are paid, it is true, by the state, but they must protect the interests of the client on behalf of the state. All this can be done. All we have to think about is the details, which have to do with the following: we do not want this to limit the capacity of those people who need legal protection. What do I mean? I mean that if we are going to make any decision on this, including at the legal level, we cannot restrict the ability of people to, for example, turn to lawyers whose services they themselves would like to use, including lawyers from the very same human rights or non-governmental organizations or specialized organizations. We must certainly think about this. This is the first thing. Now, the second part of your question on Russian culture. We say “Russian culture” but does Rasul Gamzatov represent our culture or not quite? Or take Gogol. Is he a Russian or a Ukrainian writer?  Of course, this is nonsense. As our famous musician put it, anyone who introduces such restrictions is simply a fool. They are depriving themselves of a part of world culture. Frankly, I do not even know whether we should counter this in any way. Why? Because anyone doing this is obviously an enemy of our country, and yet they are only hurting themselves. Should we prevent them from hurting themselves? This logic seems convoluted, but I do think it makes some sense. Let us think about it. That said, sensible people, including those abroad, certainly understand the stupidity of what the ruling circles are doing in some countries. The President of Turkiye, Mr Erdogan, also noted this. He recalled that only the Nazis burned books by classic writers in squares in the 1930s, and he compared it to what is being done to Russian culture today in some states. This comparison makes sense. When people from the outside, not to mention politicians at this level, draw public attention to what is happening, their actions seem to me more poignant than us trying to point out this stupidity that flourishes in some countries. Meanwhile, what is happening is perplexing; it is surprising but it is true. They are only hurting themselves. We will keep this in mind, as well as what and who we are dealing with. This means that our opinions of their moral qualities are correct. This reaffirms that what we are doing is indeed the right thing. Valery Fadeyev: Mr President, if we may, another speech; it is very important to us. You recently appointed Yelena Shishkina, a member of the presidium of the Free Donbass social movement, as a representative of the new territories at the council. Please, Ms Shishkina. Yelena Shishkina: Good afternoon, Mr President, colleagues. Mr President, I would like to convey the appreciation of the people in the new Russian regions for the opportunity to return home. We have been moving towards this for many years, and finally, this year it has happened. For us, this is a celebration, so far, with tears in our eyes, unfortunately. Regarding the regions’ support for the special military operation, nothing needs to be discussed here; our men have been defending Russian territories with weapons in hand since 2014, and women have been forging victory in the rear, and in general, because of the daily shelling of the regions, we are losing civilians every day, we are losing children, we are losing old people. Every person living in Donbass is now a hero. Maria Pirogova was such a heroine. I am grateful to you for noting her contribution to the development of Russia with a state award. There is a systemic issue, Mr President. On April 7, 2014, Donetsk and Luhansk were declared republics, but in the world community, we remained territories under Ukrainian jurisdiction. From April 2014 to September 30, 2022, when we became part of the Russian Federation, the people in the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, as well as the other new territories, were prosecuted by Ukraine for especially serious crimes. This included doctors, teachers and civil servants who did not accept the coup in 2014 and did not agree with the ruling Nazi regime. These people were convicted, and their sentences came into force under Ukrainian civil codes for crimes like high treason, espionage and the financing of terrorism; these are very serious charges. After reunification with Russia, after returning home, information from the databases of law enforcement officers of Ukraine were listed in the databases of the law enforcement system of the Russian Federation. This means that today thousands of Russian citizens, people living in the new regions, have a record, convictions for especially serious crimes, which violates their rights as guaranteed under the Constitution. They cannot be engaged in entrepreneurial activities, be foster parents, be elected, be civil servants, and so on. We cannot file an appeal with the Russian court because, according to Russian law, the courts in the Russian Federation only have jurisdiction over persons who have been illegally prosecuted and convicted by Russian Federation courts. We are dealing with the so-called state of Ukraine here.  Mr President, I kindly ask you to consider the issue of adopting a legal act to not recognise Ukraine’s criminal records or sentences for residents of the new regions who were convicted on political motives.  And regarding sentences, Ukraine has not hesitated to imprison, to hold and torture Russian-speaking residents for the past eight and a half years just because we are Russians.  In 2018, people's tribunals were held in the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics, which found top political and military leaders of Ukraine guilty of war crimes. We have notified many international human rights organisations of these convictions, but at that time we did not have the instrument for executing them, since the republics, as I said, were not recognised. Since 2014, war crimes have been recorded in the regions; they have been recorded by law enforcement agencies, and then this work was continued by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, which also involves the Public Commission, by analogy with the commission in the Soviet Union [in 1942 an emergency state commission to investigate the Nazi invader’s crimes was established in the USSR]. Mr President, an international tribunal against the Nazis was widely announced this summer. Mr Fadeyev came up with a proposal to create an international commission to investigate the Nazis’ war crimes. I kindly ask you to return to this issue. The people of Donbass demand justice, they demand that this justice be restored. We are not asking you to wipe the cities of Ukraine off the face of the earth, we know what this means, we are all experiencing it. We ask that a tribunal be held as a kind of vaccine against Nazism, so this brown plague can be stopped in its march around the world. The consequences of the crimes committed by the Ukrainian authorities – we are talking about the crimes of the collective West that is fighting against us with Ukrainian hands – include damage in addition to killed and wounded civilians. Public commissions on assessing the damage done by Ukraine’s armed aggression have been operating in the regions for many years. As of today, this estimated sum exceeds 321 billion Russian rubles and this is not a final figure; it grows every day. Moreover, we could not inspect all facilities because there is constant shelling along the frontline and there is no physical access to them. One of the damage assessment sections includes damage done to the housing of our citizens. For eight and a half years now, many people have been without housing because their buildings have been destroyed by Ukraine and our people have been fighting Nazism. They are homeless. They have to live in temporary accommodation centres, rent flats or go to neighbouring regions. These are working dynasties of miners, teachers and doctors. Donbass is a hard-working region in general. Here is another point I want to make. According to international legal standards, the state that is guilty of this damage must compensate the state that suffered from it. That state is Ukraine in this case. Since 2014, over 10,000 complaints have been sent to the European Court of Human Rights from the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics. The state of Ukraine was listed as the defendant in all cases, as represented by Poroshenko and then by Zelensky. However, our own experience has made it clear that this court is too politicised, it does not fulfil the functions outlined by its charter and is not a fair instrument of international justice. These lawsuits were not reviewed for a long time and were then returned on unrealistic formal grounds. Mr President, in this context I would like to implore you to consider the possibility of restoring the peoples’ housing in the region. I am referring to the areas we call historical – before February 24, 2022. These people have been fighting the Nazis without a roof over their heads for a year and a half now. They want to go home, work for their homeland, and to simply live and have children. It is true that Russian citizens are also in a serious situation, but the residents of these regions are subjected to daily shelling. We are working and fighting for victory on the home front while our men are defending our homeland at the frontlines. We will not let you down. Our fighters asked us to tell you that you can count on them. Thank you, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: You know, first of all, I would like to say that your men are fighting very worthily, they really set a good example for everyone else. It is amazing! Strong men, real men, this is true. This is the first thing. I cannot help saying it.  Now, regarding the questions you raised on citizens convicted for political reasons, residents of Donbass. Of course, it is necessary to put a stop to these cases and put an end to this in the absence of any actual corpus delicti. I will certainly give such an instruction to the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia. I am sure that this issue will be worked out in the shortest possible time and a decision will be made. With respect to public tribunals, you said that since 2018 such decisions have been made by public tribunals. Even if something is not implemented today, such decisions would not go amiss, and the neo-Nazi regime and its activities should be judged.  The same applies to compensation by Ukraine for the damage caused to Donbass, the citizens of Donbass, all these territories that are now Russia’s new territories. This would not go amiss. But I agree with you: it is pointless to wait for something from Ukraine and we need to help the people who have lost their homes since February 24, 2014, when these difficult, tragic events began there. I think it may be necessary to create a separate programme to help people – a programme to restore housing. We are now working in those territories where the hostilities took place not long ago. For instance, there is active work underway in Mariupol, we need to do everything we can so that people do not end up on the street; the Government has received instructions on this. This work is progressing quite quickly. I hope that people who live in Mariupol can see this.  This is happening at the expense of the federal budget, through the federal government, as well as at the expense of some regions, including St Petersburg, whose specialists work in Mariupol and are working hard at it. But we certainly need to launch a programme to support and restore housing in general in these new territories. We will definitely do this and will help people through various channels to restore their rights, including, and above all, the right to a normal life, to housing. We will do all this calmly, in working order, there can be no doubt. (Alexander Brod, chairman of the NGO Lawyers for Human Rights and a Decent Life, touched on several topics in his remarks. He primarily mentioned the situation in the border regions that are under fire, such as the Belgorod, Kursk, and Bryansk regions. Mr Brod suggested drafting a federal law providing for additional government funds to support the budgets of the regions bordering on Ukraine for rebuilding and repairing the damaged facilities. He also briefly touched on the problem of Transnistria – an unrecognised territory that ended up under an embargo due to the aggressive actions by Ukraine and Moldova. Over 200,000 residents of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic have Russian passports. They sometimes have problems travelling outside of the republic; they are subjected to humiliating searches at the Moldovan border; at the Ukrainian border, they can be either arrested or denied entry. Moldova has also introduced restrictions on gas distribution to Transnistria. The next issue he brought up concerned justice. Alexander Brod reminded listeners that Commissioner for Human Rights Tatyana Moskalkova and experts are working on a regulation to create a new international court after Russia withdrew from the Council of Europe. Russians can no longer use the mechanisms of the European Court of Human Rights. In addition, he said he would like the Supreme Court to have more interaction with the Presidential Council and with human rights organisations and experts to discuss proposals for improving Russian justice Mr Brod also noted that civic election observation has been an effective tool in Russia, and proposed considering further development in this area and expanding civic observation to all stages of elections in Russia.) Vladimir Putin: I will start where you left off. I think public control can be used at all stages of the electoral process. Why not? It would make the election process, as you said, more transparent, and the outcome will be more credible, which, in turn, would enhance the standing of any level of government authority that has made it through the election process. I agree, we need to work it through. I will ask the Government and the Executive Office to consider your proposal and to come up with their proposals. As for improving the justice system, this is an ongoing process. In this regard, I would like to say the following: indeed, many people have applied to the International Court of Human Rights. But we have the Constitutional Court, and we are not limited to just one justice system. True, we have a single judicial system, this is clear, but the Constitutional Court is a separate entity and people can appeal to the Constitutional Court. Constitutional Court President Valery Zorkin shared with me the sheer number of cases, even on very specific matters, that reach the Constitutional Court from individuals. However, this does not mean that we cannot consider other institutions to protect individual rights. Of course, we can give this some thought. Please, put your proposals in writing. The Executive Office will review them, and I will issue instructions to other agencies that deal directly with the judicial system. Regarding the people of Transnistria, the citizens of the Russian Federation and their rights, our actions must be based on reality. We have invariably stressed the importance of respecting the rights of the Russian citizens living in Transnistria to our partners and colleagues. The socioeconomic situation there is anything but simple, in terms of energy supplies, among other things. After all, we have been shipping gas there for free for many years now. Free of charge. But lately, since the gas lines run through Moldova, we have had issues there because Moldova is dealing with its own difficulties, which are substantial; we can see that in the economy and in the social sphere. Alexander Brod: Moldova is just blocking gas supply to Transnistria. Vladimir Putin: Not exactly blocking, because if they did that a portion of Ukraine would stop receiving gas for its power plants. So, the fact is not that they are blocking it, but they themselves do not have enough of it. True, given these circumstances, it is not clear why they store some of that gas, as they say, some of their Moldovan gas that they get from us, in Ukraine. We need to figure this out, and I want the Ministry of Energy to take a closer look at that. By all means, we will consider your other proposals. Thank you for taking note of that. Valery Fadeyev: Mr President, thank you. We have been working for almost three hours now. Thank you so much for the hard work. Together with the Government and the Presidential Executive Office, with the relevant subdivisions and departments, we will prepare all the instructions that have been outlined. On behalf of everyone, the entire Council, I want to thank you very much. And I hope that we are useful to the country and its people. Leonid Polyakov: Mr President, may I make a personal request? Valery Fadeyev: No, no, gentlemen, we are done. The President has another event, and we are already taking advantage of his time. Vladimir Putin: Go on, please. Leonid Polyakov: This is a very important issue. Vladimir Putin: Yes, of course, no doubt. Please Leonid Polyakov: Mr President, 15 years ago, at your personal request and direction, I participated in the creation of a new social science textbook. Back then a set was being developed: a social science and a history textbook. It seems to me that today there is an urgent need to create a new set. You noted quite rightly who started the war and when it started. All this should be in school textbooks. I have a huge personal request for you. Let us start again – the initiative should come from you. Please do it. Let new history and social science textbooks be created as soon as possible, without any delay, bidding or other things. I think there is demand for this in schools.  Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin: All right. Mr Polyakov, this is a very important issue. You are absolutely right. Thank you for insisting on asking it. The question is indeed of national importance. History is important for any nation, especially at difficult moments for the country. For us, the time has come for us to be very attentive to history and to the formation of public consciousness using reliable historical data, and it all starts with school, of course.  Therefore, I agree with Mr Polyakov and ask the Presidential Executive Office, relevant government structures, and appropriate departments to not only pay attention to this, but to take the necessary steps together with experts and specialists in order for this proposal to be incorporated in the processes that are underway in this area. I would like to thank all the members of the Presidential Human Rights Council for the work you are doing. It is always important, but especially now for Russia. I would like to repeat what I said at the beginning: it is of particular importance today, because people who feel called upon to work on issues that are important to society and each individual achieve the best results in the most important areas for society and the state, precisely because it is their calling.  Thank you very much. I would like to express my hope that we will continue this work next year as well. Well, of course, my colleagues from the Presidential Executive Office and those relevant departments you are in contact with one way or another are always at your disposal during this daily joint work. I wish you all the best and once again I want to thank you for your work.  Thank you very much. Good luck.\", 'kremlin_id': 70046, 'place': 'The Kremlin, Moscow', 'title': 'Council for Civil Society and Human Rights meeting', 'teaser': 'The President held an annual meeting of the Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, via videoconference.', 'tags': ['Human rights'], 'transcript_filtered': \"Good afternoon, colleagues. First, I would like to congratulate you on the upcoming Human Rights Day. By tradition, our meetings are timed to this event. It directly concerns each of you, as well as the council's experts, consultants, and office staff. Your joint work to protect the rights, freedoms and lawful interests of the people is a continuing operation. For many of you, these multifaceted activities – it would be no exaggeration to describe it like this – have essentially become your destiny, a calling and a life-long mission that inspires others. You are putting your heart into this work, sparing no time and effort to help those who need care and support. I would like to sincerely thank you for this very responsible and noble mission. It is gratifying that you do not relax your activities in the areas that the council continuously keeps in focus. These include education, healthcare, environmental protection, children’s rights and digitisation – there are many questions here. I know you have finished working on the draft concept of the protection of human rights and civil freedoms in the digital space of the Russian Federation and a plan of measures on implementing it. Your interested, persistent participation is also important in resolving problems of providing medications for all categories that need them, but primarily, of course, cancer patients. Both the federal Government and the regional authorities implement the majority of the council’s recommendations. This shows that the analysis of conclusions and expert examinations you suggest has become more thorough. Today, we are planning to discuss the development of legislation on non-profit organisations, ensuring citizens’ rights in the legal process, preservation of the cultural heritage and many other issues. A big bloc concerns the special military operation (SMO). Since the first day, Mr Valery Fadeyev     Fadeyev ValeryAdviser to the President  and the majority of the council members have held an abundantly clear civic position. They have been explaining the true reasons and need for the SMO, countering overt racism and aggressive Russophobia, blatant lies and mean, very mean and sneaky fake stories that are spread by foreign media and other propaganda resources.  Your work on upholding the rights and the truth, the rights of our people, the residents of Donbass, our cultural heritage and traditional values is of great significance. Importantly, you continue exposing the crimes of the Nazi regime that has asserted itself in a neighbouring country. We have emphasized many times that for eight years the rights of the residents of the much-suffering Donbass were completely ignored by the international community, the so-called international community. In the meantime, our council has addressed this issue many times. It sent information to the corresponding international institutions that are called on to ensure, support and promote human rights, but they, at any rate most of them, that are now acting as accusers, pretended to have become blind or deaf all of a sudden. It was only after the start of the SMO that the UN HRC, the Council of Europe and other so-called human rights organisations suddenly “saw the light” and began to shamelessly demonstrate what I would call their cynical bias, and to attempt to shift the blame ‘from a sick head to a healthy one’, as they say in Russia. All this meant that these organisations were unable to perform their chartered tasks. Due to their obvious bias, Russia has had to cancel its membership in a number of them. I believe that our council, as an institution dealing with a broad range of public organisations in Russia and abroad, could become an efficient international platform for discussing human rights issues and the protection of these rights in the modern world. The existing approaches require a comprehensive analysis because they are being used to achieve quite different goals, far from constructive ones. Thus, we are seeing that human rights doctrines are being used to destroy the sovereignty of states and justify Western political, financial, economic and ideological dominance.  Colleagues, I would like to thank you for your active assistance to our citizens living on the new territories. Some of you have become a true voice of the people there. Thus, journalist Marina Akhmedova has worked in Donbass since 2014. With the start of the SMO, she has visited the frontlines more than once, I know this, and organized humanitarian aid to the residents of liberated Mariupol and Volnovakha.  I would like to note that this year the membership of the council has changed significantly. It includes well-known people, such public opinion leaders as Yelena Shishkina, member of the Presidium of the Free Donbass public movement, and Olga Demicheva who heads the Doctor Liza’s Fair Aid Charity.  This organisation – we know it well – provides treatment for critically ill children from Donbass and helps the evacuated. At one time, Doctor Liza – Yelizaveta Glinka – was the first to raise this issue at council meetings. She was also the first to take these Donbass children for treatment, literally during shelling, to put it straight. I hope your experience and knowledge will be helpful for our new territories in developing civil society institutions and a modern non-commercial sector. I consider it important for the new council to continue contributing to the tasks facing the country and society, to work persistently and boldly, to raise problems that concern people and to resolve them in cooperation with the authorities.  These times are really not easy, and your opinions, positions, public speeches and statements must certainly be verified. They must work to unite our society. In fact, this is what is taking place now. Let us start our work, please. Mr Fadeyev, you have the floor, please. Mr Fadeyev, thank you very much. You noted several things, I will not comment on all of them. As for the problem with military gear, it seems to have already been resolved. Nonetheless, if anything requires special attention, please give me more information and we will sort things out as soon as possible.  A second important topic is providing support to the families of the mobilised people. Of course, this should be a matter of concern for everyone, and the state and I, of course, am counting on your support and your assistance in this work in the regions. This is the sacred responsibility of all authorities at every level, as well as of civic organisations. Of course, this involves several issues from the timely payment of salaries to simply offering help with household chores that many families of mobilised men need. So, I strongly hope these efforts will be cooperative and effective.  As for perpetrating the memory of the victims of political repression, we should not forget by any means about this work. This is a complicated and hard page in our history. History is what it is and nothing should be hidden; I have spoken about this many times. But nothing should be allowed to be used as a tool in a struggle against Russia in general, and today, in particular. However, in objectively appraising everything that is part of our history, we must respond appropriately, including where the efforts to perpetuate the memory of the victims of political repression are concerned.  I fully agree with you. Vladimir Putin (commenting on the speech by REGNUM news agency editor-in-chief Marina Akhmedova on the shelling of civilians in Donbass and the assistance to wounded soldiers in rehabilitation and prosthetic treatment): I will start with what you began with and will answer point by point. You spoke about the shelling of Donbass and the cities of Donbass and the lack of reaction from certain and even almost all our – we should put it in quotation marks – ‘Western partners.’ These human rights organisations – as we have finally seen for ourselves – were created not as a tool to protect human rights, but as an instrument of influencing the domestic policy of Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. Yes, there are various human rights organisations in the West, but they were mainly created for this purpose. In order to look neutral, they spoke about human rights in their own countries from time to time, but it was an exception. They were mostly in charge of professional work in the Russian and post-Soviet space, this was obvious. This is the first point. Second, the fact that they have been turning a blind eye to the tragedy in Donbass over the past eight years is the best confirmation to what I, Mr Fadeyev and you have said. As for the shelling of Donbass cities, you mentioned that your colleague was killed there. Yesterday, Head of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin telephoned me. It is true, residential neighbourhoods are being shelled. It is impossible that they do not know about it. Everyone is silent as if nothing was happening there. This is horrible. You said that people in Donbass are treated like second-rate people. You know, I would like to say in this relation: to those who are engaged in protecting human rights – and I just said why, in my opinion, the so-called human rights organisations in the West were created – to them, people mean nothing. They do not really consider these people second-rate; they consider Russia to be a second-rate country that does not have the right to exist. This is the problem and a disaster. This is what we are dealing with right now. We have been dealing with it throughout our history, and it is especially obvious now. We will proceed from the current reality. There can be only one answer from us: Russia will consistently fight for its national interests. This is what we will do, and let nobody believe otherwise. Yes, we will do it using various means and ways, first of all, of course, focusing on peaceful means. But if we have no choice, we will defend ourselves with everything we have. With regard to demobilising students in Donbass, indeed, these territories, these republics became part of Russia, so Russian legal regulations should apply to them in full. It is not so straightforward, and is rather a lengthy process that requires a transition period, but there are things that must be done right now, and demobilising students is one such thing. Truth be told, not all Donbass students took advantage of their right to demobilise. Literally a day ago, I had a meeting with volunteers – perhaps, you took note of it. The winner of the competition is a resident of Donetsk. I had a brief conversation with him after the meeting, and he said that this news was very positively received in Donetsk and Donbass in general, but he knows people, his comrades, who chose not to be demobilised and continue to take part in combat action. We should definitely look into demobilising some specialists, including medical doctors and prosthetists. But we need to approach matters of support and assistance more seriously. As you may be aware, I met with the mothers of the servicemen who are taking part in the special military operation, and some of them brought up questions of helping wounded and disabled soldiers. What we need to do in this regard is to arrange for up-to-date prosthetics production, to expand the capabilities of specialised enterprises and companies, since we already have them in place. Time has come to expand their operations. This is the first point. Second, we need to upgrade the equipment and to provide medications to everyone in need. It is necessary to put a rehabilitation system in place and cover travel expenses to the place of rehabilitation and back, because a wounded person, especially a person with a disability, will find it difficult or even impossible to get to a place of rehabilitation on their own. This issue needs to be addressed in a number of ways. I think we will need to create a special centre within the Government’s social block that will deal with these matters. Also, this kind of work must be done at the level of deputy governors in charge of social issues in all regions. Next, a support system for the people who need state help must be put in place. All of that must be done as soon as possible. We will definitely see to it. Thank you for raising this issue. The Government will receive corresponding instructions literally today or tomorrow. Thank you very much. Vladimir Putin (responding to Commissioner for Human Rights in the Sverdlovsk Region Tatyana Merzlyakova, who shared information about her trip to the special military operation zone, discussed the SMO zone problems, and asked the President about the likelihood of another mobilisation wave): Ms Merzlyakova, first of all I would like to thank you for what you are doing. Your work is extremely important. This kind of work is important at all times, but it is particularly important in the current circumstances. I am not going to share my assessments of those who, as you said, left the country during the mobilisation drive. It is a separate issue, and we can talk about it at length. You said it was ”not their life.” It may well be that some of them even think that this is not their country. But, again, I would leave it at that. As for the issues in the special military operation zone, they certainly existed. They are probably still there. And they can arise anytime and anywhere in the operation zone. It is important to keep an eye on these matters, to constantly analyse the unfolding developments and have feedback. This is beyond doubt. Everyone needs this, including our men on the frontline, society, and the state, because that would improve the quality and efficiency of our combat work. About leaving positions. You are aware that soldiers who try to do that in Ukraine are shot on the spot. More than that, they even conduct mass executions in public, in front of the troops. This is common knowledge. We do not practice anything of the kind, and we do not even have any, as you said, camps or incarceration facilities, or the like. This is all nonsense and fake claims and there is nothing to back them up with. Here is what I would like to say in this regard. Are there soldiers out there who have left their combat positions? Yes, it has happened. Less and less now. What is the problem? After all, a person who finds himself in a war zone – even after certain training – cannot avoid experiencing certain feelings, which is absolutely normal. The vast majority of these people return to combat duty of their own accord. The vast majority do so, even after recovering from wounds. Why? Because there is a period of adaptation to the circumstances in which they perform their military duties. To reiterate, we do not see this happening in mass proportions. All you need to do is work with people. What we need here is delicate, calm, and balanced case-by-case work with each individual. Overall, people from the Defence Ministry who are doing this professionally are getting better at it. We do not have any problems with soldiers leaving combat positions. There is no such problem as desertion in the zone of the special military operation. Yes, there have been such cases and we should not shut our eyes to them. I have already explained and said frankly what it is about. In a situation when there is shelling or bombs falling, all normal people cannot help but react to it, even on the physiological level. But after a certain adaptation period, our men fight brilliantly. I have repeatedly said that they are true heroes and deserve, as you said, to be treated as such after they fulfil their military duty and upon their arrival from the combat zone. It is absolutely obvious. The country and society, including public organisations, must create the right environment and conditions for these guys. I have already said it and want to reiterate: this also applies to the support and assistance to the families of our military personnel. We must treat them, as you said and I wrote down, as the defenders of the Motherland. This is the environment that must be created for them. Now about the possible mobilisation and the rumours surrounding it. Look, we have mobilised 300,000 people, our men, our defenders of the Fatherland. Half of them, 150,000 men, are located in the zone of the special military operation; these 150,000, half of all those mobilised, are in the troops. Of those, 77,000, only half, are members of tactical units. The rest of them are at the second and third frontiers and perform the functions of territorial defence, or undergoing training in the operation zone. Another 150,000, that is, the second half of all those mobilised, are still at the Defence Ministry testing grounds and training centres where they are undergoing additional training. They are the combat reserve, if we can call them that. These are half of those mobilised, 150,000. In this regard, talk of extending mobilisation does not make sense, and there is no need for it either for the state or the Ministry of Defence at this time. This is what I wanted to say in response to your question. (Yevgeny Myslovsky, Honourary President of the Anti-Mafia Regional Public Foundation to Combat Organised Crime and Corruption, began his remarks with the statement that “people are expecting results.” He drew attention to the following aspect of the special military operation: the investigation of war crimes by the enemy and the political significance of this investigation. He noted than over 10,000 peaceful civilians had been killed in Donetsk alone. Mr Myslovsky suggested establishing a state commission to investigate these crimes. He also discussed the deployment of law enforcement officers in the newly incorporated territories. For example, he suggested involving experienced veterans.)  Mr Myslovsky, did you mean the results of the special military operation when you said that everyone is expecting results? I see. Regarding the lengthy process and the results of the special military operation, this process could be drawn out. You also noted that newly incorporated territories have appeared. Indeed, this is a significant result for Russia, and this is a serious issue. To be honest, the Sea of Azov has become an inland sea in the Russian Federation, and these are serious things. Yes, but this is a different issue. In his time, Peter the Great fought to reach the Sea of Azov. The people living on these territories are the most important thing. The results of the referendum show that people want to live in Russia, and that they consider themselves part of this world, this space, our common culture, traditions and language. This is the most important result, and these millions of people have re-joined us. This is the most important thing.  Regarding criminal investigations, you are right, of course, but to be frank, all of us understand the realities of current developments. It is important to investigate, to record these crimes, especially strikes against civilian and residential areas. You are probably right: perhaps it would be appropriate to set up some joint agency that would address this issue and a state commission. Let us think about this. I will also ask the Prosecutor-General’s Office and the Investigative Committee to think about this issue. They should consider recruiting veteran law enforcement officers who would like to deal with this issue as mentors or as officials who can look into the available materials. I will instruct the Prosecutor-General’s Office to do this, and we will certainly think about this issue. I completely agree with you that it is necessary to record all this in a professional manner. Vladimir Putin (commenting on the questions raised in a speech by Doctor of Medical Sciences Yan Vlasov, co-chairman of the Russian Patient Association. These questions concerned, first, doctors’ salaries and raising their professional status, as well as the lack of specialists in field medicine, and the supply of medicines and consumables to the special military operation.): Thank you for the questions raised. They are all important, all of them, without exaggeration.  I will start with the question you ended your speech with, training specialists, especially for field surgery and field medical activities. Of course, the Defence Ministry believes it is doing well in general. Nevertheless, I will talk to the Ministry’s leaders and the Minister himself about the issues that you raised, and if something needs to be done, I will encourage my colleagues from the Defence Ministry to do it and ensure that it is done. This is the first thing. The second. Regarding the use of consumables, including those that, as you say, may be sitting in company warehouses, especially if they have not yet expired. Of course, we should deal with this issue, and I will definitely tell not only the Defence Minister, but also the Health Minister and Ms Golikova about this. They have the whole site in front of their eyes; let us find out what can be used and how. We will definitely do this. Especially if something is missing. Now, regarding the improvement of the medical education system as a whole. I think it is quite serious and thorough. Probably, in modern conditions, in the modern world, everything needs constant attention and constant improvement, this goes without saying, because life is developing at a very fast pace, and new opportunities, technological opportunities are emerging. We constantly talk about this, and this is constantly in the field of vision of the Health Ministry. If you think that something more needs to be done, additional steps should be taken, including the connection between medical practice and theoretical skills, then, of course, I would ask you to present your considerations in a specific form. I promise you that I will issue this as an instruction to both the Ministry of Health and the Government as a whole, and my colleagues will definitely work it out. Regarding training and re-training, the Ministry of Health has built an advanced training system. Mr Vlasov, again, if you see that something is not organised here the way it should be, or you have specific proposals on how to fix things or to improve this work, I would be grateful to you if you could submit an outline that can be used to draft a presidential instruction to the Government. We will do this by all means. It may well be that some professors are detached from reality and from clinical practice. But I know a lot of doctors who teach and engage in practical work and perform surgeries. I am sure you are aware of this; there are many specialists like that. They deserve praise and God bless them. Without a doubt, they need support in order to create and expand their own schools. Now, regarding what you started with, salaries. I agree that the remuneration system absolutely needs to be improved, especially in primary care. The Government was tasked with developing common approaches to all regions nationwide to make sure basic principles of remuneration were properly lined up. I completely agree. Of course, subsistence levels vary across regions. I mean that the cost of living varies and salaries are different, not only in public health, but in other areas as well. This must be taken into account, but in general it is important to make sure that the experiment to level incomes in the healthcare system that the Government has begun to carry out is not forgotten. This is for the future. I must agree with you that it is important to take steps to support medical workers now, without delay. In this regard, I instructed the Government to draft corresponding proposals. I would like to inform you that we have agreed – and I supported these proposals by the Government – we need to start from primary care and up. Starting January next year, I asked the Government to start making additional payments to primary care medical staff in central district hospitals, district hospitals and in the EMS system. The additional payments will range from 4,500 to 18,500 rubles depending on the position and job description. I asked the Government to start accruing these payments from January 1, 2023. If it takes some time to cut through the bureaucracy, then probably they will not be able to do it from January 1, since we are almost in the middle of December, but all the same, the technical issues should be resolved in the first quarter, and the extra payments should be calculated retroactively, from January 1, 2023. (Kirill Vyshinsky, Executive Director of the Rossiya Segodnya International Information Agency, was the next to speak. He spent a year in a Ukrainian prison for his activities as a journalist. In his remarks, he spoke about a wave of Russophobia, primarily in Europe, and cited many specific examples. In his opinion, it is time to assess this phenomenon politically and legally. He believes it is worth either supplementing a relevant article or introducing a new article on Russophobia to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. He said this phenomenon should be classified in legal terms and liability for it should be determined.)  Mr Vyshinsky, with your permission I will use your remarks to re-emphasise one idea. The point is that we did not start the war – you know this better than anyone else. It was started in 2014 after the state coup in Ukraine. It was started at that time by the Ukrainian authorities that came into the corridors of power with the help of this state coup for suppressing the will of the people living in Donbass. At that time, also in 2014, three foreign ministers – of Poland, Germany and France – came to Kiev and signed a conciliatory document between the then government in Ukraine and the opposition. They signed it as guarantors of peaceful developments. After the state coup was staged, these guarantors forgot that they were guarantors. What were they supposed to do as guarantors? They were supposed to return everything to the legal field and urge everyone to attend general elections and resolve this domestic political crisis by peaceful means. But no, nothing like this was done. Everyone seemed to have forgotten all about this document. When I remind my colleagues about it, including in telephone conversations, they are all silent – they have nothing to say. After this, hostilities began in Donbass with the use of heavy equipment, heavy weapons and aviation. This was when some European and North American countries could have developed not Russophobic but other phobic attitudes towards those who used force against civilians, against the civilian population. However, nothing of the kind happened. But what was happening all these years? The lawful interests of the people who lived there and the lawful interests of Russia to protect them were ignored. We only got spat in the face in response to all our demands. This is exactly a covert form of Russophobia. Unfortunately, it has always been present in some Western circles and our neighbours – I am referring to the nationalist circles of Ukraine. It has always been there and you talk about this very vividly. Sometimes I have time, either by chance or otherwise, but sometimes I watch your programmes. They are very convincing and profound, and I would like to thank you especially for this. Strictly speaking, this is precisely about ignoring our interests, the interests of the people who live in this land. This is Russophobia. They turned everything upside down and do not admit that they failed to fulfill their obligations as guarantors of the agreement between the government and the opposition in Ukraine in 2014. They do not admit that they trampled on these agreements or that the Ukrainian authorities who took power as a result of a coup started these hostilities. They do not talk about the killing of civilians in Donbass. They do not say anything. They only got involved when the special military operation began. And it started only because we were left with no way to resolve the situation peacefully. Leaving things the way they were was absolutely not an option. However, it was used as a pretext for fomenting anti-Russia sentiment. There is nothing surprising here from the point of view of history. Russia has often been confronted with situations like this. With regard to the authorities of some of our neighbouring countries, Poland in this case, you are aware of it as a former resident of Ukraine. Polish nationalists are bent on returning their so-called historical territories, that is, taking back the western territories that Ukraine received as a result of Joseph Stalin’s decision following WWII. As you may be aware, these territories were taken from Poland and given to Soviet Ukraine. Of course, the nationalist elements in Poland are determined to take these territories back, and they will strive to make it happen no matter who says what. We see this even in their literature, their reasoning and public speeches. This is what they will eventually try to do; I have no doubt about it. I have said it before, but I want to say it again: Russia could be the only real guarantor of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty within its current borders. Russia was instrumental in Ukraine obtaining these territories after the World War II. Under Stalin's policy, of course. But it is up to the Ukrainian politicians of the future to decide on this. In my opinion, current politicians understand little about it and are not thinking about it. Although some appear to have begun to think about this. Any kind of active involvement by Ukraine’s Western ally or neighbour in Ukrainian affairs will ultimately be aimed at taking parts of western Ukraine. One can only wish they thought about it and realised what is going on. Well, again, it is up to them to decide. I agree with your proposal. Let us work it through, and thank you for wording it that way. We cannot be surprised by isolated elements of Russophobia, including influence on children. We are aware of the fact that in some Western countries, zoo animals are killed, cut up and so on, in front of children. This is something that is absolutely not our culture, the culture of the peoples of the Russian Federation, not only the Russian people, but other ethnicities as well. But these things happen there. They work with the minds of the public in brutal ways. May God be their judge, but I think this will turn against them sooner or later. (Remarks by director of the GRANI Centre for Civic Analysis and Independent Research Foundation Svetlana Makovetskaya, an expert in Russian civil society institutions’ performance, including with regard to legal issues, covered the problems of institutional building of non-profit organisations. Svetlana Makovetskaya highlighted contradictions between the basic legislation on non-profit activities and the Civil Code and asked the President to instruct the Government together with the Presidential Council for Human Rights and expert organisations specialising in NGO experience to identify a single approach to further legislative progress in the non-profit sector. However, at the end of her remarks, Svetlana Makovetskaya turned to an issue which she believes to be of concern for a great number of people in the country, namely, the fact that at present the threat of nuclear war appears real.) I see. Concerning the threat of nuclear war. Ms Makovetskaya, you are right, the threat is growing, to be honest.  Regarding Russia never using [nuclear weapons] first under any circumstances. Well, if it does not use them first, then it will not be the second to use them either, because in the case of a nuclear strike at our territory, our capabilities will be significantly limited.  Nevertheless, our strategy of using means of defence – and we view weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons as a defence – is entirely centred around the so-called retaliatory strike, that is, we strike back when we are attacked. There are also tactical nuclear weapons, much talked about recently. The US has large stockpiles of nuclear weapons in Europe. We have never given anyone our nuclear weapons but it is natural that we will defend our allies with all means at our disposal, if needed.  What is the issue here? The point is that as much as in the previous case, when we talked about Russophobia, nobody takes notice nor wants to notice and see what is being done and talked about in the neighbouring countries, in Western countries. I reiterate that we do not deploy or have our nuclear weapons in other countries including tactical weapons, whereas the Americans do – in Turkey and a number of other European nations. They conduct drills on the possible use of these countries’ carriers for American nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, we have never done this so far. This is point number two.  Number three. Have we ever spoken about the possibility of their use? No, we have not. Whereas the former UK Prime Minister, God forgive her, said publicly that she was ready to do that. In response, I had to highlight some issues. Her statement was disregarded by everyone whereas whatever we say is immediately overemphasised, and our statements are used to scare the world.  Therefore, we have not lost our minds, we are well aware of what nuclear weapons are. We have them, and they are in a more advanced and up-to-date condition that the weapons in the possession of any other nuclear power. It is obvious, it is an obvious fact today. Yet we are not going to wield these weapons like a razor running around the globe. However, we proceed from the fact that we have them. This is a natural deterrent which does not provoke an escalation of conflicts but is rather a deterring factor. I hope everyone understands this. And now regarding your proposals on improving legal regulation and the legal base for non-profit organisations. I would like to note first that activities of non-profit organisations are vital for our country because – I have spoken about it many times, and I say absolutely sincerely that non-profit organisations are often more efficient in matters where decent, well-trained and sincere officials work hard to get the best result in their work. I mean that NGOs do not operate for money, they primarily work answering the call of the heart, and such motivation to help people, to achieve results in utterly crucial and sensitive social areas is extremely important for the end result.  Therefore, we are interested in laying an effective legal foundation. I will pass on all of your proposals – I take it you have them ready – to the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry will probably start with analysing them with the Legal Directorate of the Presidential Executive Office. I will definitely issue such an instruction and I ask you to hand over your proposals and suggestions to Mr Fadeyev. You are obviously right: it should be done together with the Government, the Human Rights Council and experts like you. (In his remarks, Chairman of the National Anti-Corruption Committee public organisation Kirill Kabanov raised issues of human rights protection in the digital space. He spoke about personal data leaks from different digital platforms, the leaks which may entail quite concrete negative repercussions for citizens, and about fraud and theft of money. Kirill Kabanov thinks it necessary to set turnover-based fines for companies which allow for leaks of personal data to happen, and also to criminalise illegal turnover of personal data. He also believes that there must be a mechanism for retrieving money stolen by criminals, because the state, including law enforcement agencies, responds to such and similar threats ineffectively and too slowly. Kirill Kabanov asked the President to issue instructions on this issue to the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, the Interior Ministry and the Central Bank.) It is undoubtedly a very urgent issue, you must have heard me talk about it when we discuss the development of modern technologies, artificial intelligence and so on, because many of them are impossible to use, impossible to apply without such data, including personal data. The question is, of course, how to protect this data. It is clearly one of the key questions for progressing on this track which is crucial for the development of the economy and social sphere. However, as of yet, not everything – I absolutely agree with you, Kirill – has been regulated and, and more regulations are needed. Also, penalties for violations in this sphere should probably be toughened. Regarding turnover-based fines and criminal liability. As I understood you, you were talking about criminal liability for illegal turnover. But those who use data must know and realise that they are using stolen data, that is certain, because even a good-faith buyer, a bona fide buyer of stolen property, does not know that the property was stolen. The same applies here. Of course, this must be thoroughly considered. But overall, you are absolutely right, this must be scrutinised and prompt balanced decisions must be taken which will at the same time protect citizens’ rights and will not hamper the development of information technologies which are vital for the state. Turnover-based fines or something of this kind must certainly be given consideration. There is good reason you mentioned turnover-based fines because for some companies these may be huge, and it is definitely a serious matter. Nevertheless, let me stress again that you are right and corresponding decisions to protect citizens must be worked out and taken. As to the recovery of assets lost by citizens due to fraud with the use of cutting-edge technologies, there are certain problems here since oftentimes such assets are stolen or people are swindled in such ways and with such means, including with the use of modern technologies, that a person seems to have given something or signed something of their free will. There is a fine line here of responsibility for what is going on. But however fine it may be, it is still there, and in such cases they are fraudulent actions which hurt citizens and violate their rights.  We know that most banks compensate such losses to citizens in most cases. But you are also right in saying that there must a certain system in place, a common approach to solving such issues. Today, most financial organisations set aside approximate amounts to compensate citizens their lost assets. However, these matters should be considered and systemised, therefore I agree with you. Respective instructions will be given to the Ministry of Digital Development, the Interior Ministry and the Central Bank. Thank you. (commenting on remarks by Moskovsky Komsomolets columnist and human rights activist Yeva Merkacheva, who spoke about conditions in pre-trial detention centres for women who have children, on excessively long pre-trial detention before a verdict is brought in, quoting a number of such cases she has knowledge of. Yeva Merkacheva also asked the President to voice his position on bringing back capital punishment since, according to her, many officials have expressed their support for this idea.) Regarding the death sentence. a short while ago Chairman of the Constitutional Court Valery Zorkin spoke about it at the congress of judges. Responding to those who favour the return of capital punishment, he said we would have to change our Constitution to do that. That is why my position has not changed in this regard. This is the first point. Second, concerning what you started with: women with children and everything related to them, to arrests etc. Ms Merkacheva, you then proceeded with other categories, and this is quite right. Why? Because as soon as you mentioned women with children, honestly, we feel pity for women behind bars, and even more so for the children who were left without their mothers, this is obvious. But we also have other categories of people, of course. Just women without children, are they any worse? Or people with disabilities? There are social justice issues, and we need a uniform treatment of all those categories of citizens. This is the first point.  Second, it is quite obvious that if a person spends five years behind bars in the pre-trial detention centre waiting for the trial, it is an obvious violation of human rights. We have talked about it repeatedly, and I told the leadership of the Investigative Committee, the Interior Ministry and other law enforcement agencies that such practices must be terminated. There must be deadlines for investigating any criminal case; cases must not drag on indefinitely citing insurmountable objective difficulties. And if an investigation of a case is not completed by the deadline – true, there are some very complicated cases – then either the case must be dropped or at least the suspect must be released without applying other pre-trial restrictions. There are many different situations in life, Unfortunately, women with children are sometimes used by drug dealers, say, for stashing drugs and so on. There are many real-life situations. Therefore, we must strive to avoid extremes and to have a generally just court and law enforcement system. That is what we must be striving for.  I will definitely issue instructions both to the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Interior Ministry, and I will ask the Supreme Court to analyse practices of this kind.  Concerning the fact that some people are taken to interrogation in handcuffs, especially in cases involving economic crimes, I have no words to characterise it. But I promise you that we will not only focus our attention on that but we will make sure that this practice is definitely stopped.  Will you please write your proposals down on paper and submit them. We will certainly work on that. As I said, I will ask both the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Supreme Court to thoroughly analyse all these issues, and the Investigative Committee, too.  (Olga Demicheva, President of the International Charitable NGO Doctor Liza’s Fair Care, who recently returned from Donbass, said that doctors from the Republican Trauma Centre in Donetsk asked her to tell the President of Russia that they are working, that they will continue to work, that they have considered themselves Russian citizens since 2014. They work under constant shelling, with power cuts, no water, often in cold rooms. They go to work in the morning and do not know if they will return home alive. And yet they do not ask for anything. Ms Demicheva stressed that those people who have been in the Donetsk and Luhansk republics since 2014, who made their choice and who stayed there to live and work, are special people, they are Russia's special value. Olga Demicheva spoke about the most pressing problems facing Donbass in providing medical care during the transition period. For example, before the special military operation started, humanitarian missions of the World Health Organisation, which entered the territory of the DPR and LPR, provided these republics with diagnostic tests, preventive medicine, medications to treat tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis C and so on. Now they have left, and the chief doctors of the relevant clinics say that these resources are now insufficient and it is necessary to close this gap. Olga Demicheva also spoke about the assistance needed by Russian non-profit organisations that are now helping Donbass. In addition, she noted that over almost nine years a wealth of experience in treating mine-blast injuries has been accumulated in Donbass and Russian surgeons and traumatologists need to make use of it). First of all, thank you for continuing the work that was started by Elizaveta Glinka [Dr Lisa]. But the issues are certainly no less urgent, maybe even more acute, compared to the period when your predecessor was heroically engaged in this work. Regarding the doctors in Donbass. Yes, of course, they have great, serious experience in treating certain patients, especially with mine blast injuries and so on, and we should use this. But at the same time, it is clear that they need to be retrained, to get more knowledge, to gain experience with modern equipment, which needs to be provided there. Of course, for the most part, doctors, especially those who work in such difficult conditions, are a special kind of people, with a special character and special, noble motivation. They are not asking for anything, but of course, they must soon fully enter our legal field, the field of social protection, salary levels and so on. All of this, of course, must be done, and we have spoken about it many times. I have talked repeatedly with both the Healthcare Minister and Ms Golikova, who as Deputy Prime Minister oversees this sector. And the relevant plans for work with our colleagues in the new territories are now being finalised and will be implemented. And now, as you know, work is already underway. Unfortunately, one of their Russian colleagues has just died in one of these territories. It is tragic: it happened as a result of a car accident; the driver could not negotiate a slippery road. But she was there for a reason, not on a tourist trip. She was assisting the local doctors in rendering medical aid, first of all to children, checkups for children. She had been working there for quite a long time. This ongoing work needs to become systematic. You are absolutely right, thank you for pointing this out, and especially for saying that we need medications for treating socially significant diseases, meaning HIV, tuberculosis, and so on, which used to come from various organisations. Yes, many of them are apparently gone, and this niche needs to be filled as soon as possible, if indeed it has appeared. Judging by what you say, this niche exists. And we will certainly deal with it now, we will by all means. As for the conditions in which people live and work, this is also an answer to the topic we have just discussed with your colleagues. You mentioned the lack of water in proper quantity and of proper quality. It is the water supply facilities that are controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces that are preventing this water from reaching the million-strong city. This is genocide, this is just a continuation of genocide. No one is paying attention to this, no one. And this is further proof that we are doing everything right. We simply have no choice; we cannot act in any other way. But in carrying out the special military operation, we certainly have to address current issues, and above all social issues, to support, including, in this case, medical workers in all the areas I have mentioned. We will certainly do it. Thank you for your attention to these matters, and thank you for continuing, I want to emphasise it again, what your heroic predecessor did. Thank you very much. (In his statement, Shota Gorgadze, Managing Partner of Gorgadze & Partners Law Firm, touched on the narrow professional issue of protecting the rights of people who have been declared by a court to be either of limited legal capacity or deprived of such. He stressed the need for a lawyer to be involved in such cases, including by appointment, with the possibility of this lawyer being paid from the budget. He asked the President to recommend to the State Duma that they amend the civil procedure accordingly. However, Mr Gorgadze went on to raise an issue that, in his words, worries any reasonable Russian citizen. It is not just rabid Russophobia, attempts to turn the image of a Russian into an enemy, but also attempts to ban Russian culture. For example, Mr Gorgadze mentioned the scandal at the opera house of La Scala with the season opening with Musorgsky's opera ”Boris Godunov.“ The Ukrainian ambassador to Italy protested against this. Mr Gorgadze said that Russian culture, which has become part of world culture and which some rather foolish people are now trying to remove from the world's treasury, requires protection.) Mr Gorgadze, the first thing is to restore the legal standing of those of our citizens who have been declared incapacitated. Of course, I will instruct the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection and other relevant agencies to think about this and propose solutions. This is not about money. Probably, not that much budget money will be required – how many such appeals could there be? This mandatory participation of a lawyer by order of the state and at the expense of the state, this practice is widely used, and court appointed lawyers are paid, it is true, by the state, but they must protect the interests of the client on behalf of the state. All this can be done. All we have to think about is the details, which have to do with the following: we do not want this to limit the capacity of those people who need legal protection. What do I mean? I mean that if we are going to make any decision on this, including at the legal level, we cannot restrict the ability of people to, for example, turn to lawyers whose services they themselves would like to use, including lawyers from the very same human rights or non-governmental organizations or specialized organizations. We must certainly think about this. This is the first thing. Now, the second part of your question on Russian culture. We say “Russian culture” but does Rasul Gamzatov represent our culture or not quite? Or take Gogol. Is he a Russian or a Ukrainian writer?  Of course, this is nonsense. As our famous musician put it, anyone who introduces such restrictions is simply a fool. They are depriving themselves of a part of world culture. Frankly, I do not even know whether we should counter this in any way. Why? Because anyone doing this is obviously an enemy of our country, and yet they are only hurting themselves. Should we prevent them from hurting themselves? This logic seems convoluted, but I do think it makes some sense. Let us think about it. That said, sensible people, including those abroad, certainly understand the stupidity of what the ruling circles are doing in some countries. The President of Turkiye, Mr Erdogan, also noted this. He recalled that only the Nazis burned books by classic writers in squares in the 1930s, and he compared it to what is being done to Russian culture today in some states. This comparison makes sense. When people from the outside, not to mention politicians at this level, draw public attention to what is happening, their actions seem to me more poignant than us trying to point out this stupidity that flourishes in some countries. Meanwhile, what is happening is perplexing; it is surprising but it is true. They are only hurting themselves. We will keep this in mind, as well as what and who we are dealing with. This means that our opinions of their moral qualities are correct. This reaffirms that what we are doing is indeed the right thing. You know, first of all, I would like to say that your men are fighting very worthily, they really set a good example for everyone else. It is amazing! Strong men, real men, this is true. This is the first thing. I cannot help saying it. Now, regarding the questions you raised on citizens convicted for political reasons, residents of Donbass. Of course, it is necessary to put a stop to these cases and put an end to this in the absence of any actual corpus delicti. I will certainly give such an instruction to the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia. I am sure that this issue will be worked out in the shortest possible time and a decision will be made. With respect to public tribunals, you said that since 2018 such decisions have been made by public tribunals. Even if something is not implemented today, such decisions would not go amiss, and the neo-Nazi regime and its activities should be judged.  The same applies to compensation by Ukraine for the damage caused to Donbass, the citizens of Donbass, all these territories that are now Russia’s new territories. This would not go amiss. But I agree with you: it is pointless to wait for something from Ukraine and we need to help the people who have lost their homes since February 24, 2014, when these difficult, tragic events began there. I think it may be necessary to create a separate programme to help people – a programme to restore housing. We are now working in those territories where the hostilities took place not long ago. For instance, there is active work underway in Mariupol, we need to do everything we can so that people do not end up on the street; the Government has received instructions on this. This work is progressing quite quickly. I hope that people who live in Mariupol can see this.  This is happening at the expense of the federal budget, through the federal government, as well as at the expense of some regions, including St Petersburg, whose specialists work in Mariupol and are working hard at it. But we certainly need to launch a programme to support and restore housing in general in these new territories. We will definitely do this and will help people through various channels to restore their rights, including, and above all, the right to a normal life, to housing. We will do all this calmly, in working order, there can be no doubt. (Alexander Brod, chairman of the NGO Lawyers for Human Rights and a Decent Life, touched on several topics in his remarks. He primarily mentioned the situation in the border regions that are under fire, such as the Belgorod, Kursk, and Bryansk regions. Mr Brod suggested drafting a federal law providing for additional government funds to support the budgets of the regions bordering on Ukraine for rebuilding and repairing the damaged facilities. He also briefly touched on the problem of Transnistria – an unrecognised territory that ended up under an embargo due to the aggressive actions by Ukraine and Moldova. Over 200,000 residents of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic have Russian passports. They sometimes have problems travelling outside of the republic; they are subjected to humiliating searches at the Moldovan border; at the Ukrainian border, they can be either arrested or denied entry. Moldova has also introduced restrictions on gas distribution to Transnistria. The next issue he brought up concerned justice. Alexander Brod reminded listeners that Commissioner for Human Rights Tatyana Moskalkova and experts are working on a regulation to create a new international court after Russia withdrew from the Council of Europe. Russians can no longer use the mechanisms of the European Court of Human Rights. In addition, he said he would like the Supreme Court to have more interaction with the Presidential Council and with human rights organisations and experts to discuss proposals for improving Russian justice Mr Brod also noted that civic election observation has been an effective tool in Russia, and proposed considering further development in this area and expanding civic observation to all stages of elections in Russia.) I will start where you left off. I think public control can be used at all stages of the electoral process. Why not? It would make the election process, as you said, more transparent, and the outcome will be more credible, which, in turn, would enhance the standing of any level of government authority that has made it through the election process. I agree, we need to work it through. I will ask the Government and the Executive Office to consider your proposal and to come up with their proposals. As for improving the justice system, this is an ongoing process. In this regard, I would like to say the following: indeed, many people have applied to the International Court of Human Rights. But we have the Constitutional Court, and we are not limited to just one justice system. True, we have a single judicial system, this is clear, but the Constitutional Court is a separate entity and people can appeal to the Constitutional Court. Constitutional Court President Valery Zorkin shared with me the sheer number of cases, even on very specific matters, that reach the Constitutional Court from individuals. However, this does not mean that we cannot consider other institutions to protect individual rights. Of course, we can give this some thought. Please, put your proposals in writing. The Executive Office will review them, and I will issue instructions to other agencies that deal directly with the judicial system. Regarding the people of Transnistria, the citizens of the Russian Federation and their rights, our actions must be based on reality. We have invariably stressed the importance of respecting the rights of the Russian citizens living in Transnistria to our partners and colleagues. The socioeconomic situation there is anything but simple, in terms of energy supplies, among other things. After all, we have been shipping gas there for free for many years now. Free of charge. But lately, since the gas lines run through Moldova, we have had issues there because Moldova is dealing with its own difficulties, which are substantial; we can see that in the economy and in the social sphere. Not exactly blocking, because if they did that a portion of Ukraine would stop receiving gas for its power plants. So, the fact is not that they are blocking it, but they themselves do not have enough of it. True, given these circumstances, it is not clear why they store some of that gas, as they say, some of their Moldovan gas that they get from us, in Ukraine. We need to figure this out, and I want the Ministry of Energy to take a closer look at that. By all means, we will consider your other proposals. Thank you for taking note of that. Go on, please. Yes, of course, no doubt. Please All right. Mr Polyakov, this is a very important issue. You are absolutely right. Thank you for insisting on asking it. The question is indeed of national importance. History is important for any nation, especially at difficult moments for the country. For us, the time has come for us to be very attentive to history and to the formation of public consciousness using reliable historical data, and it all starts with school, of course.  Therefore, I agree with Mr Polyakov and ask the Presidential Executive Office, relevant government structures, and appropriate departments to not only pay attention to this, but to take the necessary steps together with experts and specialists in order for this proposal to be incorporated in the processes that are underway in this area. I would like to thank all the members of the Presidential Human Rights Council for the work you are doing. It is always important, but especially now for Russia. I would like to repeat what I said at the beginning: it is of particular importance today, because people who feel called upon to work on issues that are important to society and each individual achieve the best results in the most important areas for society and the state, precisely because it is their calling.  Thank you very much. I would like to express my hope that we will continue this work next year as well. Well, of course, my colleagues from the Presidential Executive Office and those relevant departments you are in contact with one way or another are always at your disposal during this daily joint work. I wish you all the best and once again I want to thank you for your work.  Thank you very much.

The medal recipients received greetings from by Hero of Russia, First Deputy Chair of the State Duma Committee on Defence Andrei Krasov, and Hero of Russia, member of the Federation Council Committee on Defence and Security Dmitry Perminov. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, colleagues, comrades, Today we pay tribute to the Heroes of the Fatherland. People of various eras, times, fates and personalities, whose names are inscribed in the history of our state, performed heroic feats and deeds – military, labour and civilian – in the name of our Motherland, in the name of our people.  The recipients of the Order of St George, founded by Catherine the Great, as well as the Order of Glory, Heroes of the Soviet Union and Heroes of the Russian Federation – we honour everyone who earned their high title with their courage and self-sacrifice, and now, at this time, we feel especially keenly that the link of times is unbreakable, that the sacred feeling of love for the Motherland is passed down through generations and is an absolute, supreme value. Our country has faced great challenges many times, and our people responded with an unbreakable unity to all attempts to encroach upon our state’s security and independence, and stood united to defend our homeland in the battlefield and on the home front.  We bow before our ancestors who created the great, victorious history of Russia and take pride in our soldiers, officers, volunteers and militia who are fighting now in the special military operation, who are performing their military duty with honour when defending the lives and dignity of our citizens, as well as our shared right to choose our own path. Today, the highest state awards will be presented to military personnel who demonstrated exceptional valour and courage during the special military operation and earned the Hero of Russia title. I sincerely thank you for serving your Motherland, for your loyalty to the ideals that have always, at all times, rallied Russia together. I would also like to address those who are on the frontlines now: for me, for all our fellow citizens, each of you is a hero. And I really want you to feel the warmth of our hearts, and the warmth of this truly nationwide support. Friends, Heroism is based on one’s love for their Motherland and a deep awareness of their duty be it military, civil, or professional, a clear idea, deep down, of how one should live their life, what kind of values to uphold and to defend, and how to act in difficult, extreme situations. This is what guides people who choose professions that involve great personal risk, but at the same time, lead their whole country to success and achievement. And today, I will be happy to present awards to our test cosmonauts. All heroes put their duty before everything else – all those people who rescue others at great personal risk, who perform remarkable exploits at work, in science, in industry, in teaching or in the medical field, in various fields, who give their energy and expertise, working hard for the sake of their nation, their homeland, who are worthy successors of the centuries-old history of accomplishments by our people. I am sure that the lives and deeds of the Heroes of the Fatherland serve as the most important moral reference point for the majority of citizens in our vast country, that they inspire us to always achieve more, go forward and create, for the benefit of the people, and together make our country stronger and more successful. Greetings on Heroes of the Fatherland Day. <…> Vladimir Putin: Friends, Many of those who received awards today spoke about their devotion to their Motherland, and they have proved, not in words but in deeds, that it is the law they live by. In the midst of combat, and in any situation involving extreme danger, every person wants to stay alive and whole, and wants to see their friends, family, children, wives, and parents again. But this sense of self-preservation, which is natural for every human, fades into the background when people live by higher meanings and higher ideals of devotion to their nation. Today is a holiday, but we must remember those who are not with us today, the people who perished while defending their Motherland, as well as those now recovering from wounds – let us wish health and prosperity to all of them. We must also remember their families, the people who have been the closest to them and who have made them heroes – their parents, their classmates at school (maybe even from kindergarten) and colleagues at work. I wish all the best to all of you today. I would like to say and confirm what the awardees have said here today, that you are on a great mission. When you talk about your Motherland, you must never forget that your Motherland is not just a territory; your Motherland includes the people you are defending. That is what your Motherland is. We all realise this, and we are grateful to you and your comrades-in-arms for what you are doing for our Motherland. Happy holiday!

Colonel Maxim Stefanov, Head of the 267th Flight Research Test Centre, Deputy Head of the Defence Ministry 929th State Flight Test Centre: Since 2000. Vladimir Putin: What aircraft have you handled? Maxim Stefanov: All the newest ones. The latest one is the Sukhoi Su-57, which we are using now to carry out the goal of protecting our interests. The plane has proven itself worthy. I hope that it will contribute to our victory. Vladimir Putin: Yes, yes. Aviation is performing very well. It is very good to have this in combat duty, actually around-the-clock. They have shown themselves to be very effective, to do everything as scheduled and to work very competently. Both attack aircraft and Sukhois – Su-34 and 35 – are fighting perfectly, very well. The armament is good. Great, just great. They are making a significant contribution to the effectiveness of troop operations. But you probably know this. Maxim Stefanov: Yes, sir. Vladimir Putin: As it was said here, and I have also said that the Fatherland means people above all, and we must always remember this. First of all, we are doing everything for the people, in order to protect them, and we must have faith internally that we are doing it with dignity, and do it exactly like this because the country and those people who need protection, they understand that the last hope is on you. This is the case. All nonsense, information confrontation, information dumps, and all sorts of fake stories should be put aside, should not prevent us from fulfilling our duty to our people. And you do not have to be particularly sophisticated about this information battle to understand what is really happening. Right now, there is a lot of buzz about our attacks on the energy infrastructure of a neighbouring country. Yes, we are doing this, but who started it? Who hit the Crimean Bridge? Who blew up the power lines from the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant? Who is not supplying water to Donetsk? Not distributing water to a city of millions is an act of genocide. No one anywhere has said a word about this, the silence is complete. As soon as we move and do something in response: noise and uproar are raised all across the universe. This will not interfere with our combat missions. And I want to thank you that you and your comrades are doing this in the most dignified way. Thank you very much. Once again, I congratulate you on this high award of the Fatherland. Remark: Thank you. Vladimir Putin: And Happy New Year to you! It is unlikely that we will see each other before the New Year.

I think this meeting is timely and very significant. Cooperation as part of the SCO and the CIS enables us to attain a wide range of objectives, primarily having to do with protecting our countries from external threats and ensuring global and regional stability while relying on mutual respect and consideration of each other's interests. This is especially important today as new drastic challenges are emerging, and major geopolitical shifts are taking place. The outlines of a truly multipolar world order are appearing before our eyes: new development centres are being formed in Asia, Africa and Latin America, which are increasingly defending their national interests, protecting their sovereignty, and the right to choose their own development trajectory. It is simply impossible to resist these objective historic processes. At the same time, the conflict potential is growing in the world, as a direct consequence of the attempts, by certain Western elites, to maintain their political, economic, financial, military and ideological dominance. They would go to any lengths to preserve it, even consciously exacerbate chaos and cause an international escalation. The United States and its satellites rely on the power factor. They have actually destroyed the architecture of strategic stability the world had been building for decades, aggressively expanding NATO’s geography. They are resorting to illegal economic and trade sanctions to contain and derail any alternative development models; they are using methods such as “colour revolutions” to displace unwanted governments and foment military conflicts and escalate tension and confrontation in various regions around the world with their open provocations. We see the grave consequences of such actions in Ukraine today. The West has been shamelessly draining and exploiting its resources for years, while encouraging genocide and terror in Donbass, in fact turning that country into a colony. Now the West is cynically using the Ukrainian people as cannon fodder, as a battering ram against Russia, continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons and ammunition, sending mercenaries, and pushing it towards a suicidal path. I am convinced that the nature and scale of today's threats raise the requirements concerning cooperation between our defence agencies. It is imperative to work in cooperation and build a more flexible and sustainable security and cooperation system that can handle the current challenges. It should not be based on some mythical unwritten rules that no one has ever seen, or on someone's dominance or monopoly, but only on international rights and respect for each other's interests. We consider it necessary to continue to develop within the SCO and the CIS a constant exchange of defence policy information, to share experience of building the national armed forces, to expand defence cooperation, and to put the latest weapons and equipment into service. I would like to note that for many years now our respective countries’ military contingents have been practicing coordination during joint exercises and other operational and combat training events. Manoeuvres of the CSTO   Background information Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO)    rapid response and rapid deployment, reconnaissance and logistics collective forces, exercises of the Joint CIS Air Defence System, as well as the SCO anti-terrorist command and staff exercises are held regularly. Such joint training and addressing non-standard tasks are important for improving the quality of military command and control. Joint peacekeeping missions have become exceptionally important as well. It is crucial to further improve the peacekeeping units’ operational capabilities and to keep them involved in UN peace-keeping efforts. We appreciate the longstanding traditions of cooperation between the SCO and the CIS in the field of training and advanced training of military personnel. We will continue to expand this key area and to use the Russian military universities and academies’ scientific potential, basic educational and methodological facilities and combat training centres of the Russian Armed Forces. In closing, I would like to wish productive work to the participants. I am sure that close partnership in the defence sphere will raise our countries’ standing and influence, contribute to strengthening security and stability in Eurasia and the world as a whole and, without a doubt, will promote the traditions of friendship and trust between our countries and peoples.

Unfortunately, recently we have also seen an escalation of tensions in Nagorno-Karabakh in the Russian peacekeepers’ zone of responsibility. I am sure you are aware that the Lachin corridor was recently blocked, and there are very strong concerns in Nagorno-Karabakh about this. Of course, we always discuss these issues.

            "{'date': '2022-12-09T16:55:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon. Please, go ahead. Maria Sidibe, RIA Novosti: The EAEU is finishing the year with excellent growth numbers across the board, and I wanted to know what you attribute this to, because the global economy is in a tight spot and more sanctions are being imposed. Where do these numbers come from? What do you think about the outcome of today's meeting? Also, what will become of the EAEU as we go forward? What are your near- and medium-term forecasts? Vladimir Putin: Regarding good results, they could have been better. We wanted them to be better. True, some said the Russian economy would fall by 20 percent. There is a decline, indeed, but only 2.9 percent. Without a doubt, this is a big difference, and we know that those who predicted this scenario for us were sorely mistaken, while we did not make a mistake. We cannot say that we are doing fine either, however, because there is a recession. But our situation is indeed better than in many other countries in several ways. Inflation, as I mentioned, will be a little over 12 percent, around 12.2–12.3 percent for the year, whereas in Europe it will be anywhere from 17 to 20 percent, even above 20 percent. This is absolutely off the scale for the European economy. This is clearly the case, no one made these numbers up. The same applies to food and construction, and I mentioned earlier as well. Regarding the EAEU in general, the situation is stable. One of the key benchmarks, unemployment, is lower than in many other countries. What is this result based on? Well, it is based on the foundations of our economies, including the Russian economy in no small measure, and on the economic stabilisation measures that we are taking in Russia and the EAEU as a whole. Unlike some countries, we are not closing down anything. We are not breaching market economy principles. We are not imposing any restrictions on ourselves. On the contrary, we are doing our best to ensure the free flow of capital, goods and labour. This is important for us and for our EAEU partners. It has practical importance. Speaking of macroeconomic indicators, the stability of the Russian currency, the ruble, has a beneficial effect on our partners’ economies and financial systems. Say, we are talking about unemployment. It is lower here than during the pandemic: 4.7 percent before the pandemic and 3.9 percent now. But it is vital for our EAEU partners. It is no secret that hundreds of thousands if not millions of citizens from these countries, our friends and partners, work in Russia. This means their labour is in demand. This means they are sending money [home] to support their families in their countries, and this money is a substantial part of revenues of this or that country. This is the next part. One more component is the energy market. I have already said that gas prices in Europe are skyrocketing. They are already …1,700 [dollars for a thousand cubic metres], right? What is the current price, Alexei? Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller: 1,500. Vladimir Putin: No, no, it was 1,700 the day before yesterday. The gas we sell to some countries is more than 10 times cheaper. Do you understand this? Not just ten times cheaper but more than 10 times cheaper. But this is a stabilising factor for the economies of our partners – they can forecast their development, support their households and manufacturing industries. They are all developing agriculture, in part, based on the chemical industry, based on fertilisers. All are developing fertilisers very fast. This is a very efficient industry.  We do not have any problems with basic products – we are exporters. We supply our partners with food as well and at quite affordable prices, wherever they need it.  This is how it all looks in a package. I would say that what also matters in the final result is the desire to work together and seek solutions, even where it took us years to reach them in the course of difficult talks, but this was the result. We are still figuring it out and coming to terms. Therefore, all this taken together gives joint work a positive result. I really agree with this.  You have also asked me about our next steps, right? Maria Sidibe: Yes. I asked what you think about the development of the organisation in the near future. Vladimir Putin: Our next steps and development prospects. I think our prospects are very good, and our next steps are very specific.  The first thing we need to do, on which we agreed, and I think this is a very important agreement – we agreed to create a mechanism to support our cooperation activities in real production, in the industrial sector. I believe this is very important for enhancing our general technological self-sufficiency, our technological sovereignty. Incidentally, this is the result of our work today. In the near future, the next couple of years or so, we must bring to life the earlier achieved agreements, such as to create a single gas market over the next two years, to identify the principles of its operation and to move on to building a common electricity market which is a critically important matter for us as well. It is hard work, and there are many questions related to coordinating our positions. You know, we had a very good discussion about this, and many things became clear. It is not Russia's position to hold the line on prices, to raise prices, or not to send something to someone. No. It is a matter of price and, above all, a matter of coordinating economic policy. Subsidising domestic prices is done at different levels, and different reasons are behind this approach, including socioeconomic and even political and historical reasons. In a given country, housing and utility prices are heavily subsidised, and these subsidies cannot be cancelled overnight due to a number of socio-political and even economic reasons. It takes time to get there. In another country, subsidies might be lower and prices are determined by the market. Let's take transport tariffs. Look, tariffs are about the same anywhere you go in Russia. They may differ slightly, but we are trying to level them. Where would the cheapest gas be? A place that is the closest to the gas field with no transport expenses. Gas should be the cheapest in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area. But Russia is a vast country, and we cannot make gas cheap in only the Yamalo-Nenets Area and insanely expensive in the Far Eastern Federal District or on our western borders. In fact, we subsidise transport costs for the end consumer. But in order for us to be able to talk about a single gas market, we must come up with common subsidising principles. Everyone understands this. This takes time, teamwork in the area of taxation, in our efforts to coordinate the rules and amend tax codes, and in the functioning of the tax system itself based on the latest technology. There are no differences or misunderstandings as to how we are supposed to get these results. All we need to do is work hard over the next two years. I think we will be able to achieve good results in many of these areas. The prospects for expanding the transport infrastructure and supply chains are excellent. Many countries are interested in the new, modern North-South and East-West corridors. Everyone, even the countries that are not members of our organisation, are willing – if we go ahead with some of the earlier announced projects – to join us in co-financing, because it is a highly lucrative project. We have lots of important and exciting projects that are of interest to all EAEU members. If there is interest, I am sure the organisation will become stronger, and these projects will get implemented. Aysel Gereikhanova, Rossiyskaya Gazeta: A question about Viktor Bout. For a long time, Russia sought his exchange, and it has finally happened. I would like to hear the details: who led the talks, will they continue? And do these meetings on the exchange indicate that there is a chance to establish a broader dialogue with the Americans, or is this just about the swap?  And one more question: will Sergei Naryshkin's contacts with the head of the CIA continue? Vladimir Putin: So, as far as swaps are concerned, this subject is being handled by us, in this case, it was handled by the Federal Security Service, the FSB. The FSB was agreeing on and negotiating this initially and achieved the results you have just heard about. The contacts continue; in fact, they never stopped at the level of special services. Are other swaps possible? Yes, anything is possible. This is the result of talking and searching for compromise. In this case, compromises were found. We will not refuse to continue this work in the future. Can this be considered a precedent to a dialogue with the United States on other issues? This is a special question, a specific one, frankly. We did not have the goal to move from these talks to other ones. Of course, they create a certain atmosphere, it is true; but no other issues were discussed as part of these talks. This is the first thing. Second, regarding contacts between the special services, the Foreign Intelligence Service and the CIA, from one side and the other. This was not our initiative but was initiated by the American side. President Biden suggested this, and we agreed, as you can see. We generally did not expect anything supernatural from the talks; they were held in a normal working mode. The partners agreed that these meetings would continue. Please. Pavel Zarubin, Rossiyskaya Gazeta: Good evening. Back to oil and gas prices: the price cap on Russian oil introduced by the West is one of the most discussed global topics in the last few days. There are already a lot of arguments about this, so I would like to ask such a specific question. How will we ultimately respond to this? Will this response be proportionate, symmetrical, asymmetrical? And what will happen to the Russian budget in the end? Will Russia have enough revenue? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Do not worry about this. The point is this: the proposed cap is in line with today’s prices. In this sense, this policy does not affect us in any way; frankly, it does not matter much to us. Yes, formally, oil prices are a little higher, but they are a little lower for our blend. Brent prices are higher, and Urals prices are slightly lower, plus we offer discounts to many of our partners. Everything comes down to that number. We will not lose anything under any circumstance. But this is not the point. This concerns not only us, but all producers, because if anyone ever agrees to consumers setting prices, it will destroy the industry, because consumers will always want low prices. Even without that, the industry is underinvested and underfunded, and if we heed what consumers are telling us, then the investment will come to nothing. At some point this will trigger a disastrous surge in prices and the global energy market will collapse. This is how it will end up. This proposal is stupid, ill-conceived and poorly evaluated. So, it is not about us, but about the overall situation in global energy and global energy markets. It [the proposal] is bad for global energy markets. Again, we are already selling at about these prices, so do not worry about the budget. To reiterate, it would be a stupid thing to do for everyone, including consumers, to follow some kind of non-market, harmful decision. Consumers need to realise that if they insist on prices they like, even if they have these prices, prices will then plummet, investment will be reduced to zero, and ultimately the prices will skyrocket and this will backfire on those who are imposing these kinds of solutions. With regard to our response, I said earlier that we will simply not sell energy resources to countries that adopt such policies. We will even think about – I am not saying we have decided on this – but we will think, if necessary, about a production cut. We have an agreement with OPEC Plus on a production target. We will give it further thought, if needed. I am talking about Russia now. Again, we are thinking about this, but no decisions have been made yet. Specific steps will be outlined in a Presidential Executive Order that will be issued soon. Yes, please. Konstantin Panyushkin, Channel One: Good afternoon. A question about the special military operation. What do you think about the status of the SMO? Talking with human rights activists on Wednesday, you said, this is a quote: “This will be a lengthy process.” If possible, can you explain what you had in mind? And another question from the same meeting. You said, and I quote: “If Russia does not use nuclear weapons first, it won’t use them second, either.” This caused an uproar. Please explain what you meant. Vladimir Putin: As for the length of the SMO, I was referring to the time needed for the settlement process. The SMO is running its course and everything is stable – there are no questions or problems there now. As you can see, the Defence Ministry operates transparently. It reflects everything that is taking place in reality, on the ground, in its daily reports. This is how it stands, objectively, in this regard. I have nothing to add. As for the settlement process in general – yes, it will probably be complicated and will take some time. But one way or another, the parties to this process will have to accept the realities that are taking shape on the ground. This is the first part of your question. Now the second part. I understand that everyone is worried and has always been worried since the advent of nuclear arms, and weapons of mass destruction in general. People, all of humanity, have been concerned about what will happen to the planet and to us? But look what I had in mind, I will explain some things. The United States has this theory of a preventive strike. This is the first point. Now the second point. They are developing a system for a disarming strike. What does that mean? It means striking at control centres with modern high-tech weapons to destroy the opponent’s ability to counterattack, and so on. What are these modern weapons? These are cruise missiles that we did not have at one time – we did not have land-based cruise missiles. We removed them; we scrapped them. Meanwhile, the Americans were smarter at that time when they were holding talks with the Soviet Union. They scrapped land-based missiles but retained air- and sea-based missiles that were not covered by the treaty, and we became defenceless. But now we have them and they are more modern and even more efficient. There were plans to deliver a preventive disarming strike with hypersonic weapons. The United States does not have these weapons, but we do. Regarding a disarming strike, perhaps we should think about using the achievements of our US partners and their ideas about how to ensure their own security. We are just thinking about this. No one was shy about discussing it out loud in the past. This is the first point. The United States has a theory and even practice. They have the concept of a preventive strike in their strategy and other policy documents. We do not. Our Strategy talks about a retaliatory strike. There are no secrets whatsoever. What is a retaliatory strike? That is a response strike. It is when our early warning system, the missile attack warning system, detects missiles launched towards Russian Federation territory. First, it detects the launches, and then response actions begin. We hold regular exercises of our nuclear forces. You can see them all, we are not hiding anything. We provide information under our agreements with all nuclear countries, including the United States. We inform our partners that we are conducting these exercises. Rest assured they do the exact same thing. After the early warning system receives a signal indicating a missile attack, hundreds of our missiles are launched and they cannot be stopped. But it is still a retaliatory strike. What does that mean? It means that enemy missile warheads will fall on the territory of the Russian Federation. This cannot be avoided. They will fall anyway. True, nothing will remain of the enemy, because it is impossible to intercept hundreds of missiles. And this is, without a doubt, a potent deterrent. But if a potential adversary believes it is possible to use the preventive strike theory, while we do not, this still makes us think about the threat that such ideas in the sphere of other countries’ defence pose to us. That is all I have to say about that. Yulia Bubnova, TASS: Good afternoon. Angela Merkel said the other day that at the time the Minsk agreements were signed with the express purpose of giving Ukraine time to prepare and then to fight Russia. Could you explain how we should understand this? Did we know that our partners were treating us in this way?  Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Honestly, this was a complete surprise to me. This is disappointing. Frankly speaking, I did not expect to hear this from the former Federal Chancellor because I always thought that the leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany were sincere with us. Of course, they were on Ukraine’s side and supported Ukraine, but I still thought they had always been sincerely striving for a settlement on the principles which we had agreed on and which were accepted, including in the Minsk agreements. What you have just said only shows that we did everything right by starting the special military operation. Why? Because it transpired that nobody was going to fulfil these Minsk agreements. The Ukrainian leaders also mentioned this, in the words of former President Poroshenko, who said he signed the agreements but was not going to fulfil them.  But I was still hoping that other participants in this process were sincere with us. It appears they were deceiving us as well. The only purpose was to pump arms into Ukraine and get it ready for hostilities. We are seeing this, yes. Apparently, we got our bearings too late, frankly. Perhaps we should have started all this sooner, but we still simply hoped to come to terms under these Minsk peace agreements. What can one say to this? Of course, the issue of trust is at stake. Trust as such is already close to zero, but after such statements, the issue of trust is coming to the fore. How can we negotiate anything? What can we agree upon? Is it possible to come to terms with anyone, and where are the guarantees? This is, of course, a problem. But eventually we will have to come to terms all the same. I have already said many times that we are ready for these agreements, we are open. But, naturally, all this makes us wonder with whom we are dealing.  Ksenia Golovanova, Interfax: Mr President, did you have a chance to discuss, here in Bishkek, with the President of Kazakhstan and the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan the idea that President Tokayev recently expressed, citing you, regarding the creation of some kind of tripartite gas union. It is a known fact that Tashkent has been receiving gas from Gazprom via Turkmenistan for a long time now. Why was the issue of Russian gas supplies brought up at this point, which gas pipeline system could be used for this, and do you think gas distribution from Russia to Uzbekistan could start soon? Vladimir Putin: There are no secrets here. We started with the first question. Your colleague asked this question and kind of indicated that, overall, the EAEU countries’ economies are in satisfactory condition, stable at least, and prospects are good. This is the way it really is. This means that these economies will grow. They are growing now and will continue to grow in the future. In turn, it means that energy consumption will increase. There are shortages already. And energy-producing, gas-producing countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are looking forward, and this is the right approach. They have excellent economic teams and stable political leadership. The presidents of both countries are looking forward and running the numbers to see how much they will need in the coming years. They are coming to the conclusion that they will need higher volumes and more resources, keeping in mind, among other things, their export obligations from previous years. They have export obligations to deal with. All of that – their own higher consumption needs and their export obligations that they need to honour – have us sitting down again and comparing notes to see how it works out and if we can do more. Can we do it or not? Yes, we can. But there are many questions. For example, northern Kazakhstan gets its gas from Orenburg. However, gas goes to Orenburg, to our gas processing plant, from Karachaganak, a gas field in Kazakhstan. It goes to Kazakhstan at domestic Russian prices. In order to pump gas to Uzbekistan, we need to use a gas transport system that was built back in the Soviet Union. It needs to be repaired since it is in a state of disrepair. There are two gas lines. One is not used at all, and the second is used to transport gas from Karachaganak to Orenburg. So, if this gas is to be sent to Uzbekistan, should it be forwarded directly or reversed and then sent? This is a big question. This begs another question: in that case, we need to build a separate pipeline system via Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan and build internal infrastructure for additional distribution to Central Asia in Russia which will cost us around 260 billion rubles. There are many issues that need to be looked into and mutually agreed upon, maybe we will even need to reach compromises. Compromises can definitely be struck. In this sense, it could be an energy alliance. But we also have obligations to the EAEU countries. Uzbekistan is still an observer state, but it is also a good opportunity for Uzbekistan to take a closer look at EAEU activities and find common ground with it. There is not a single insurmountable obstacle here, but it requires systemic work at the expert level and financial evaluations, coordination, and participation of each country in these investments. Everyone is ready to go, by the way. Everyone wants to be part of this teamwork and some are even ready for joint investment. This is a positive, big, and very promising work with good prospects. We will work on it. The work is underway. Our colleagues from Kazakhstan are coming to Moscow, I think. Our colleagues from Uzbekistan were in Moscow not long ago. Alexei Miller will go there, and this effort is underway at the level of deputy prime minister. Work is underway; it has a good foundation to build on, and I am sure the results will be good. I saw someone raise their hand. Please, go ahead. Edmund Zhelbunov, NTV: Thank you very much. Mr President, a quick follow-up on the SMO. I could not help noticing the badge you are wearing today. You recently said that there is definitely no need to resume the partial mobilisation at this point. To make it a little more specific, what factors could make you reconsider? Or, Russians definitely have nothing to worry about, even after the New Year celebrations? Vladimir Putin: No, I do not see such factors today. Like I said, 300,000 men were called up as part of the mobilisation – let me say it again – 150,000 have been deployed with the force. Of those who are in the force, only half, or a little more, 77,000 are deployed with combat units. The other half are deployed with the second or third tier. Actually, they act as territorial troops, or engage in additional training. Another 150,000 are not even in the force yet. They are at the training grounds and training bases. What additional mobilisation? Half of all mobilised recruits can be considered a combat reserve. So, there is no reason to talk about an additional mobilisation. This is out of question as we speak. Alexander Yunashev, Life: Will you let them go at some point? Is it necessary to replace them with someone else? Vladimir Putin: You know, strange as it may seem, we also discussed this. We will have to see how it goes, how it develops. Perhaps it would make sense to replace some formations with others – in this case, they will still have the status of participants in hostilities. Some people may be still undergoing training say, in the Far East or Siberia, whereas others may be fighting in the zone of hostilities. These are different things. But it is necessary to look at all this. The Defence Ministry and the General Staff are thinking about this and will make a decision. At any rate, as for mobilisation, I think I have given an exhaustive answer to this question. Let’s have another question, please. Don Courter, Russia Today: Mr President, Josep Borrell said Africa supports Russia because of this – I quote: “You can consider that these people do not know where Donbass is or maybe they do not even know who Putin is.”  What is your response to this? Vladimir Putin: Borrell is a big, major figure of our time, a political figure of our time, as Brezhnev was once described.  But people in Africa know what Russia is and where Russia is located. Africans know the role that Russia played in their liberation from colonialism. There is practically not a single African country that would not receive our support at one time – political, information, economic and sometimes military support. We have very stable, very kind and friendly relations with African nations and they continue.  If the people you were talking about knew where Africa is located and what state African nations are in, they would not have prevented the supplies of Russian food and Russian fertilisers from reaching the African continent. Eventually, the harvest in African countries and the saving of hundreds of thousands of people in Africa from starvation depend on these supplies. Our fertilisers have not yet even left some seaports of European countries. Meanwhile, as I have said many times, we are ready to provide them to African countries free of charge. Partially this process got underway under pressure from the UN Secretary-General but the problem has not been resolved up to this day. Let certain EU politicians stop chatting about their love of African nations and start giving direct support to them. Instead of buying up food on global markets using the money they are printing, instead of raising prices, fuelling inflation and putting African nations into a desperate situation, they should at least not get in Russia’s way and let it carry out this productive and intensive work that is needed by African nations and is designed to support the people who need it. Let’s call it a day. Thank you very much. Yes, Andrei, all right, go ahead. This will be the closing question. Andrei Kolesnikov: Andrei Kolesnikov, Kommersant newspaper. Vladimir Putin: Yes, I know. Andrei Kolesnikov: Today Ilya Yashin got… Vladimir Putin: Who is he? Andrei Kolesnikov: A blogger. Vladimir Putin: What did he get? Andrei Kolesnikov: He got 8.5 years under the fake news article. Don’t you think that 8.5 years for fake stories is a brutal sentence? Vladimir Putin: You know what they say: anyone can speculate. I received my basic education at Leningrad State University, and I will tell you that I think it is absolutely unacceptable to interfere in the work of the courts. I do not think it is appropriate to question court decisions; there are certain statutory rights to protect citizens in the way that they would like to do it. It may be possible to appeal to a higher court. Mr Yashin's lawyers probably know what they have to do. Vera Desyatova, Vesti FM and Mayak radio stations: Could I ask one more question? Vladimir Putin: Go ahead. Vera Desyatova: Thank you very much. Recently, there have been some conflicting reports about the army's supplies. You said that the problems are being addressed or have been addressed, but the stream of messages from the fighters on the frontline has not stopped. Our military correspondents and volunteers receive requests. They ask not only for uniforms, but also for medicines, because consumables run out very quickly. And the question is: who should we trust? The Defence Ministry's reports or the soldiers on the frontline? Vladimir Putin: You cannot trust anyone. Only I can be trusted. (Laughter.) We work with the Defence Ministry on a regular basis. I discuss these issues with them almost every day. I have to say that there were problems indeed, and, judging by what you are saying, they probably persist. Although I am assured that they are becoming fewer and are no longer as acute as they were at the beginning of this process, especially related to mobilisation. But from what you have said, and I think you are right, the problems are far from being completely resolved. But it is just a matter of time. The most acute ones, I think, have already been resolved, but some time is needed, of course, to speed up the relevant production sectors. And the Ministry of Industry is now actively involved in this. Vladimir Putin: Go ahead, but this will be the last one. Pavel Zarubin: Early this week you drove along Crimean Bridge. The Crimean Bridge project is something special to you. What were your impressions this time?  Vladimir Putin: Not just to me – but the country in general.  Pavel Zarubin: To you, to the country and to all of us.  Vladimir Putin: I just wanted, first of all, to support the builders and thank them, because they did so much within a short timeframe, and their work is of good quality. Of course, I wanted to see if this was true or not, because it is one thing, what is written on the official reports, that the work has been finished, and quite another when people who are not involved in it, provide you with information. It is important to have this information. The same goes in this case, I mean the bridge, as I wanted to see it with my own eyes, how everything was done in reality. And indeed, in terms of quality and technology, the project was done at a top technical and technological level.  I said earlier – I do not know if people could hear me because of the strong wind – that two lanes in one direction were in good condition, but the builders still insisted that some centimetres or even millimetres of those lanes be improved, so they are up to standard, 100 percent. They will be doing this part as a preventive measure, so to say, and they obtained approval from me. They will now close two lanes or have already closed them, I do not know, and will be improving them to bring them up to standards, so they are 100 percent perfect.  There is another bridge above, as we actually have three bridges there, the other is the railway bridge; one track is fully functional and there is no tonnage limit on freight traffic. But the other track was largely damaged by fire because the train was standing and a fuel tank car was punctured, the fire caused the damage so it needs to be put in order.  They promise to finish repairing the highway sections in March; first, they planned to finish it later, but I was told they had promised to finish all work by the end of March. As for the [damaged] track on the railway bridge, they promise to finish repairs by mid-summer. True, first, they said this would happen by late autumn, but then they committed to finish it by mid-summer. I believe it will be done sometime next summer. Their work is of good quality. I have no doubt that everything will be done on schedule.   Thank you very much. All the best to you.\", 'kremlin_id': 70061, 'place': 'Bishkek', 'title': 'News conference following the visit to Kyrgyzstan', 'teaser': 'Concluding his working visit to Kyrgyzstan, the President answered journalists’ questions.', 'tags': ['Foreign policy', 'Media'], 'transcript_filtered': \"Good afternoon. Please, go ahead. Regarding good results, they could have been better. We wanted them to be better. True, some said the Russian economy would fall by 20 percent. There is a decline, indeed, but only 2.9 percent. Without a doubt, this is a big difference, and we know that those who predicted this scenario for us were sorely mistaken, while we did not make a mistake. We cannot say that we are doing fine either, however, because there is a recession. But our situation is indeed better than in many other countries in several ways. Inflation, as I mentioned, will be a little over 12 percent, around 12.2–12.3 percent for the year, whereas in Europe it will be anywhere from 17 to 20 percent, even above 20 percent. This is absolutely off the scale for the European economy. This is clearly the case, no one made these numbers up. The same applies to food and construction, and I mentioned earlier as well. Regarding the EAEU in general, the situation is stable. One of the key benchmarks, unemployment, is lower than in many other countries. What is this result based on? Well, it is based on the foundations of our economies, including the Russian economy in no small measure, and on the economic stabilisation measures that we are taking in Russia and the EAEU as a whole. Unlike some countries, we are not closing down anything. We are not breaching market economy principles. We are not imposing any restrictions on ourselves. On the contrary, we are doing our best to ensure the free flow of capital, goods and labour. This is important for us and for our EAEU partners. It has practical importance. Speaking of macroeconomic indicators, the stability of the Russian currency, the ruble, has a beneficial effect on our partners’ economies and financial systems. Say, we are talking about unemployment. It is lower here than during the pandemic: 4.7 percent before the pandemic and 3.9 percent now. But it is vital for our EAEU partners. It is no secret that hundreds of thousands if not millions of citizens from these countries, our friends and partners, work in Russia. This means their labour is in demand. This means they are sending money [home] to support their families in their countries, and this money is a substantial part of revenues of this or that country. This is the next part. One more component is the energy market. I have already said that gas prices in Europe are skyrocketing. They are already …1,700 [dollars for a thousand cubic metres], right? What is the current price, Alexei? No, no, it was 1,700 the day before yesterday. The gas we sell to some countries is more than 10 times cheaper. Do you understand this? Not just ten times cheaper but more than 10 times cheaper. But this is a stabilising factor for the economies of our partners – they can forecast their development, support their households and manufacturing industries. They are all developing agriculture, in part, based on the chemical industry, based on fertilisers. All are developing fertilisers very fast. This is a very efficient industry.  We do not have any problems with basic products – we are exporters. We supply our partners with food as well and at quite affordable prices, wherever they need it.  This is how it all looks in a package. I would say that what also matters in the final result is the desire to work together and seek solutions, even where it took us years to reach them in the course of difficult talks, but this was the result. We are still figuring it out and coming to terms. Therefore, all this taken together gives joint work a positive result. I really agree with this.  You have also asked me about our next steps, right? Our next steps and development prospects. I think our prospects are very good, and our next steps are very specific.  The first thing we need to do, on which we agreed, and I think this is a very important agreement – we agreed to create a mechanism to support our cooperation activities in real production, in the industrial sector. I believe this is very important for enhancing our general technological self-sufficiency, our technological sovereignty. Incidentally, this is the result of our work today. In the near future, the next couple of years or so, we must bring to life the earlier achieved agreements, such as to create a single gas market over the next two years, to identify the principles of its operation and to move on to building a common electricity market which is a critically important matter for us as well. It is hard work, and there are many questions related to coordinating our positions. You know, we had a very good discussion about this, and many things became clear. It is not Russia's position to hold the line on prices, to raise prices, or not to send something to someone. No. It is a matter of price and, above all, a matter of coordinating economic policy. Subsidising domestic prices is done at different levels, and different reasons are behind this approach, including socioeconomic and even political and historical reasons. In a given country, housing and utility prices are heavily subsidised, and these subsidies cannot be cancelled overnight due to a number of socio-political and even economic reasons. It takes time to get there. In another country, subsidies might be lower and prices are determined by the market. Let's take transport tariffs. Look, tariffs are about the same anywhere you go in Russia. They may differ slightly, but we are trying to level them. Where would the cheapest gas be? A place that is the closest to the gas field with no transport expenses. Gas should be the cheapest in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area. But Russia is a vast country, and we cannot make gas cheap in only the Yamalo-Nenets Area and insanely expensive in the Far Eastern Federal District or on our western borders. In fact, we subsidise transport costs for the end consumer. But in order for us to be able to talk about a single gas market, we must come up with common subsidising principles. Everyone understands this. This takes time, teamwork in the area of taxation, in our efforts to coordinate the rules and amend tax codes, and in the functioning of the tax system itself based on the latest technology. There are no differences or misunderstandings as to how we are supposed to get these results. All we need to do is work hard over the next two years. I think we will be able to achieve good results in many of these areas. The prospects for expanding the transport infrastructure and supply chains are excellent. Many countries are interested in the new, modern North-South and East-West corridors. Everyone, even the countries that are not members of our organisation, are willing – if we go ahead with some of the earlier announced projects – to join us in co-financing, because it is a highly lucrative project. We have lots of important and exciting projects that are of interest to all EAEU members. If there is interest, I am sure the organisation will become stronger, and these projects will get implemented. So, as far as swaps are concerned, this subject is being handled by us, in this case, it was handled by the Federal Security Service, the FSB. The FSB was agreeing on and negotiating this initially and achieved the results you have just heard about. The contacts continue; in fact, they never stopped at the level of special services. Are other swaps possible? Yes, anything is possible. This is the result of talking and searching for compromise. In this case, compromises were found. We will not refuse to continue this work in the future. Can this be considered a precedent to a dialogue with the United States on other issues? This is a special question, a specific one, frankly. We did not have the goal to move from these talks to other ones. Of course, they create a certain atmosphere, it is true; but no other issues were discussed as part of these talks. This is the first thing. Second, regarding contacts between the special services, the Foreign Intelligence Service and the CIA, from one side and the other. This was not our initiative but was initiated by the American side. President Biden suggested this, and we agreed, as you can see. We generally did not expect anything supernatural from the talks; they were held in a normal working mode. The partners agreed that these meetings would continue. Please. Do not worry about this. The point is this: the proposed cap is in line with today’s prices. In this sense, this policy does not affect us in any way; frankly, it does not matter much to us. Yes, formally, oil prices are a little higher, but they are a little lower for our blend. Brent prices are higher, and Urals prices are slightly lower, plus we offer discounts to many of our partners. Everything comes down to that number. We will not lose anything under any circumstance. But this is not the point. This concerns not only us, but all producers, because if anyone ever agrees to consumers setting prices, it will destroy the industry, because consumers will always want low prices. Even without that, the industry is underinvested and underfunded, and if we heed what consumers are telling us, then the investment will come to nothing. At some point this will trigger a disastrous surge in prices and the global energy market will collapse. This is how it will end up. This proposal is stupid, ill-conceived and poorly evaluated. So, it is not about us, but about the overall situation in global energy and global energy markets. It [the proposal] is bad for global energy markets. Again, we are already selling at about these prices, so do not worry about the budget. To reiterate, it would be a stupid thing to do for everyone, including consumers, to follow some kind of non-market, harmful decision. Consumers need to realise that if they insist on prices they like, even if they have these prices, prices will then plummet, investment will be reduced to zero, and ultimately the prices will skyrocket and this will backfire on those who are imposing these kinds of solutions. With regard to our response, I said earlier that we will simply not sell energy resources to countries that adopt such policies. We will even think about – I am not saying we have decided on this – but we will think, if necessary, about a production cut. We have an agreement with OPEC Plus on a production target. We will give it further thought, if needed. I am talking about Russia now. Again, we are thinking about this, but no decisions have been made yet. Specific steps will be outlined in a Presidential Executive Order that will be issued soon. Yes, please. As for the length of the SMO, I was referring to the time needed for the settlement process. The SMO is running its course and everything is stable – there are no questions or problems there now. As you can see, the Defence Ministry operates transparently. It reflects everything that is taking place in reality, on the ground, in its daily reports. This is how it stands, objectively, in this regard. I have nothing to add. As for the settlement process in general – yes, it will probably be complicated and will take some time. But one way or another, the parties to this process will have to accept the realities that are taking shape on the ground. This is the first part of your question. Now the second part. I understand that everyone is worried and has always been worried since the advent of nuclear arms, and weapons of mass destruction in general. People, all of humanity, have been concerned about what will happen to the planet and to us? But look what I had in mind, I will explain some things. The United States has this theory of a preventive strike. This is the first point. Now the second point. They are developing a system for a disarming strike. What does that mean? It means striking at control centres with modern high-tech weapons to destroy the opponent’s ability to counterattack, and so on. What are these modern weapons? These are cruise missiles that we did not have at one time – we did not have land-based cruise missiles. We removed them; we scrapped them. Meanwhile, the Americans were smarter at that time when they were holding talks with the Soviet Union. They scrapped land-based missiles but retained air- and sea-based missiles that were not covered by the treaty, and we became defenceless. But now we have them and they are more modern and even more efficient. There were plans to deliver a preventive disarming strike with hypersonic weapons. The United States does not have these weapons, but we do. Regarding a disarming strike, perhaps we should think about using the achievements of our US partners and their ideas about how to ensure their own security. We are just thinking about this. No one was shy about discussing it out loud in the past. This is the first point. The United States has a theory and even practice. They have the concept of a preventive strike in their strategy and other policy documents. We do not. Our Strategy talks about a retaliatory strike. There are no secrets whatsoever. What is a retaliatory strike? That is a response strike. It is when our early warning system, the missile attack warning system, detects missiles launched towards Russian Federation territory. First, it detects the launches, and then response actions begin. We hold regular exercises of our nuclear forces. You can see them all, we are not hiding anything. We provide information under our agreements with all nuclear countries, including the United States. We inform our partners that we are conducting these exercises. Rest assured they do the exact same thing. After the early warning system receives a signal indicating a missile attack, hundreds of our missiles are launched and they cannot be stopped. But it is still a retaliatory strike. What does that mean? It means that enemy missile warheads will fall on the territory of the Russian Federation. This cannot be avoided. They will fall anyway. True, nothing will remain of the enemy, because it is impossible to intercept hundreds of missiles. And this is, without a doubt, a potent deterrent. But if a potential adversary believes it is possible to use the preventive strike theory, while we do not, this still makes us think about the threat that such ideas in the sphere of other countries’ defence pose to us. That is all I have to say about that. Honestly, this was a complete surprise to me. This is disappointing. Frankly speaking, I did not expect to hear this from the former Federal Chancellor because I always thought that the leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany were sincere with us. Of course, they were on Ukraine’s side and supported Ukraine, but I still thought they had always been sincerely striving for a settlement on the principles which we had agreed on and which were accepted, including in the Minsk agreements. What you have just said only shows that we did everything right by starting the special military operation. Why? Because it transpired that nobody was going to fulfil these Minsk agreements. The Ukrainian leaders also mentioned this, in the words of former President Poroshenko, who said he signed the agreements but was not going to fulfil them.  But I was still hoping that other participants in this process were sincere with us. It appears they were deceiving us as well. The only purpose was to pump arms into Ukraine and get it ready for hostilities. We are seeing this, yes. Apparently, we got our bearings too late, frankly. Perhaps we should have started all this sooner, but we still simply hoped to come to terms under these Minsk peace agreements. What can one say to this? Of course, the issue of trust is at stake. Trust as such is already close to zero, but after such statements, the issue of trust is coming to the fore. How can we negotiate anything? What can we agree upon? Is it possible to come to terms with anyone, and where are the guarantees? This is, of course, a problem. But eventually we will have to come to terms all the same. I have already said many times that we are ready for these agreements, we are open. But, naturally, all this makes us wonder with whom we are dealing.  There are no secrets here. We started with the first question. Your colleague asked this question and kind of indicated that, overall, the EAEU countries’ economies are in satisfactory condition, stable at least, and prospects are good. This is the way it really is. This means that these economies will grow. They are growing now and will continue to grow in the future. In turn, it means that energy consumption will increase. There are shortages already. And energy-producing, gas-producing countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are looking forward, and this is the right approach. They have excellent economic teams and stable political leadership. The presidents of both countries are looking forward and running the numbers to see how much they will need in the coming years. They are coming to the conclusion that they will need higher volumes and more resources, keeping in mind, among other things, their export obligations from previous years. They have export obligations to deal with. All of that – their own higher consumption needs and their export obligations that they need to honour – have us sitting down again and comparing notes to see how it works out and if we can do more. Can we do it or not? Yes, we can. But there are many questions. For example, northern Kazakhstan gets its gas from Orenburg. However, gas goes to Orenburg, to our gas processing plant, from Karachaganak, a gas field in Kazakhstan. It goes to Kazakhstan at domestic Russian prices. In order to pump gas to Uzbekistan, we need to use a gas transport system that was built back in the Soviet Union. It needs to be repaired since it is in a state of disrepair. There are two gas lines. One is not used at all, and the second is used to transport gas from Karachaganak to Orenburg. So, if this gas is to be sent to Uzbekistan, should it be forwarded directly or reversed and then sent? This is a big question. This begs another question: in that case, we need to build a separate pipeline system via Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan and build internal infrastructure for additional distribution to Central Asia in Russia which will cost us around 260 billion rubles. There are many issues that need to be looked into and mutually agreed upon, maybe we will even need to reach compromises. Compromises can definitely be struck. In this sense, it could be an energy alliance. But we also have obligations to the EAEU countries. Uzbekistan is still an observer state, but it is also a good opportunity for Uzbekistan to take a closer look at EAEU activities and find common ground with it. There is not a single insurmountable obstacle here, but it requires systemic work at the expert level and financial evaluations, coordination, and participation of each country in these investments. Everyone is ready to go, by the way. Everyone wants to be part of this teamwork and some are even ready for joint investment. This is a positive, big, and very promising work with good prospects. We will work on it. The work is underway. Our colleagues from Kazakhstan are coming to Moscow, I think. Our colleagues from Uzbekistan were in Moscow not long ago. Alexei Miller will go there, and this effort is underway at the level of deputy prime minister. Work is underway; it has a good foundation to build on, and I am sure the results will be good. I saw someone raise their hand. Please, go ahead. No, I do not see such factors today. Like I said, 300,000 men were called up as part of the mobilisation – let me say it again – 150,000 have been deployed with the force. Of those who are in the force, only half, or a little more, 77,000 are deployed with combat units. The other half are deployed with the second or third tier. Actually, they act as territorial troops, or engage in additional training. Another 150,000 are not even in the force yet. They are at the training grounds and training bases. What additional mobilisation? Half of all mobilised recruits can be considered a combat reserve. So, there is no reason to talk about an additional mobilisation. This is out of question as we speak. You know, strange as it may seem, we also discussed this. We will have to see how it goes, how it develops. Perhaps it would make sense to replace some formations with others – in this case, they will still have the status of participants in hostilities. Some people may be still undergoing training say, in the Far East or Siberia, whereas others may be fighting in the zone of hostilities. These are different things. But it is necessary to look at all this. The Defence Ministry and the General Staff are thinking about this and will make a decision. At any rate, as for mobilisation, I think I have given an exhaustive answer to this question. Let’s have another question, please. Borrell is a big, major figure of our time, a political figure of our time, as Brezhnev was once described. But people in Africa know what Russia is and where Russia is located.

In all, 11,500 appeals have been received. Chairman of the Constitutional Court Valery Zorkin     Zorkin ValeryConstitutional Court President : Approximately. Each year, this figure reaches about 12,000 to 13,000 or slightly less. Mr President, surprisingly, the situation changed significantly following the amendments to the Constitution and the Federal Constitutional Law. Now it is possible to appeal to the Constitutional Court only after a person has gone through all other courts, including the Supreme Court. Earlier, this was possible even without the Supreme Court. I believe that this is the best option because ordinary courts defend people. I want to say that the number of complaints has not diminished, although everyone spoke about allegedly more difficult access.  Vladimir Putin: Yes.  Valery Zorkin: In reality, this is not so. We are satisfied from this standpoint, and we are working hard.  Vladimir Putin: You have reviewed over 50 cases.  Valery Zorkin: This amounts to rulings or serious decisions when the future of a law is decided: either we retract this law from the current legal system and recognise it as unconstitutional, or we provide such an interpretation that makes it impossible to apply this law in its previous form.  A person appealing in line with his or her personal case and interests essentially decides the future of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of cases that were resolved in the past. Vladimir Putin: This implies a certain precedent.  Valery Zorkin: It appears that he or she has received a bonus, and all others will receive them in the future, too…  Vladimir Putin: In similar situations…  Valery Zorkin: From this standpoint, the Constitutional Court is, of course, a unique tool of the judicial system.  Vladimir Putin: What cases do most appeals deal with? Valery Zorkin: We handle many social sector cases and many cases with criminal or administrative verdicts. It may be surprising, but we have started dealing with bankruptcy legislation as of late. We have even written a special brief for legislators and for the Government because, of course, there are discrepancies there.  Why did I say this, by way of example? I find it hard to find issues not covered by the Constitutional Court. They include labour and pension rights, criminal verdicts and administrative fines.  We are not sitting idle, although I do not want to say that we are unable to straighten our backs. Of course, we realise that, quite possibly, lower-instance judges, including district judges or magistrates, also find the going hard. I know that their desks are overflowing with papers, etc.  Vladimir Putin: Your work has its own specifics. The decisions mentioned by you, these 50-plus resolutions, have great significance for many people.  Valery Zorkin: They do.  The Constitutional Court compiles reviews of resolutions in time for December 12. However, these are not all our rulings. Our reviews contain the most significant decisions that determine the future of laws. Either they recognise them as unconstitutional or they provide such an interpretation that directly influences law-enforcement practice. All our judges sign them.  Vladimir Putin: I see.  Valery Zorkin: I would like to wish all the best to you, as the guarantor of the Constitution, above all.  Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

A 58-kilometre section of the M-12 Moscow-Nizhny Novgorod-Kazan motorway was opened as part of the West-East transport corridor, in the Vladimir Region. This route makes it possible to bypass several communities. A 35-km and a 20-km sections of the R-351 Yekaterinburg-Tyumen and R-242 Perm-Yekaterinburg federal roads in the Sverdlovsk Region were widened from two to four lanes. A transport interchange was launched at the intersection of the M-8 Kholmogory motorway with the Mytishchi road network in the Moscow Region. This interchange is part of the North-South route. A 62-km section of the M-4 Don motorway has reopened in the Voronezh Region following an overhaul. The reconstruction has been completed of a 500-metre tunnel towards the Mamison all-season recreational facility in South Ossetia, too.  A domestic flights terminal was also opened at the Vladikavkaz International Airport, to handle 800,000 passengers annually. The launch of the above-mentioned facilities increases the capacity of motorways, makes Russian regions more accessible and reduces the duration of trips.  * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, friends.  I am happy to greet you all. Today, we are opening a number of new transport infrastructure facilities in various Russian regions. I congratulate you all from the bottom of my heart.  First of all, I would like to sincerely thank all specialists working in the road construction sector, including workers, engineers, designers and employees of numerous affiliated enterprises. Your professionalism, responsibility, persistence and teamwork helped keep up the rapid pace of work and carry out the plans for this year. We can now review some of the 2022 performance results. This year will certainly set a record in the volume of asphalt paved on regional and local roads – about 165 million square metres. Last year was quite productive too, with around 162 million square metres of improved road surfacing. But this year has seen growth, slight, but still noticeable. It is especially important for regional and local roads. This means that the country has received more high-quality and modern motorways, that vehicle traffic has become faster, more comfortable and safer, and that our cities and towns are more interconnected.  It is also important that we continued to develop promising international transport corridors. We need them to create convenient transportation routes, to facilitate effective logistics, and to unlock the potential of nearby territories. Today, we are taking another step towards accomplishing this large-sale objective.  We will open three new sections of the M-12 Moscow-Kazan-Yekaterinburg route, part of the West-East transport corridor. Two of them will open in the Sverdlovsk Region, and one more will open in the Vladimir Region.  In this connection, I would like to note that I have instructed the concerned officials to conduct a public vote on choosing a name for this significant motorway and for the entire West-East transport corridor that links St Petersburg with Vladivostok. I would like to ask Mr Khusnullin to report on the results of this contest. Today, we are launching transport infrastructure facilities of the North-South corridor, including an interchange near the town of Mytishchi in the Moscow Region, as well as an upgraded section of the M-4 Don motorway in the Voronezh Region. The motorway will now facilitate high-speed traffic between Moscow and the Rostov Region and, of course, towards the Black Sea and Sea of Azov basin. Millions of holidaymakers will be able to travel more comfortably in summer.  In North Ossetia, we are opening a new domestic flights terminal at the Vladikavkaz airport, as well as a tunnel towards the Mamison recreational facility. All this will facilitate expanded tourism in southern Russia. The competitive advantages of this region will become more pronounced, and the local investment climate will also improve. Doubtless, we must continue to create effective transport corridors. We need to boost the capacity of Russian motorways by expanding the road network, and we also have to reduce the share of congested federal and regional routes. At the same time, it is important to improve the organisation of road traffic to minimise the number of bottlenecks and congested areas. Our key priorities include efforts to reduce the number of locations where numerous road accidents occur, as well as other accident-prone sections. I have already issued instructions on this issue, and I would like to note once again that efforts to save the lives of Russian citizens and to preserve their health directly depend on this. I am confident that we will jointly implement all road construction plans, no matter what, and that we will achieve all our goals. In conclusion of my opening remarks, I would like to cordially thank everyone who worked to build the new facilities. I wish you every success in the future and all the best.

I recently met with [Deputy Prime Minister] Dmitry Grigorenko     Grigorenko DmitryDeputy Prime Minister – Chief of the Government Staff , who spoke about a new phase in reforming the control and supervision activity and improving permitting. Mr Mishustin     Mishustin MikhailPrime Minister of the Russian Federation  and I agreed that Mr Grigorenko should talk about this at a larger meeting to update all of us once again, and all those concerned, of course – economic actors will also hear this once again and will have an idea of what the Government is planning to do. But first, as our usual practice has been, we will discuss current issues that are of particular interest, and I would like to ask Ms Popova     Popova AnnaHead of the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor)  to start with the current epidemiological situation. I see that, unfortunately, cases of seasonal colds and flu are growing, by almost 30–35 percent per week. Ms Popova, what is the situation today? (Head of the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare Anna Popova briefed the meeting on the current epidemiological situation in the country. Minister of Healthcare Mikhail Murashko commented on the issue. Deputy Prime Minister Viktoria Abramchenko reported the implementation of a federal project to improve the Volga River environment.  Minister of Labour and Social Protection Anton Kotyakov spoke about the creation of the Russian Social Fund. In turn, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov reported on the adjustment of insurance premium payment deadlines in 2022.

Head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova: Good afternoon, Mr President, colleagues, Mr President, you are certainly right; it is true that we have a tense epidemiological situation in the Russian Federation today. This is due to two processes: the first is the growing COVID incidence rate; the increase is small, but we have recorded it for the fourth week running after the previous decrease for two months; it remains around 10–11 percent every week but it is here and will continue to be here. The second situation is high growth rate of ARVI, a group of respiratory infections and flu. It is plus 30 to 35 percent from week to week. Over the last week and the week before, we recorded increases in both new cases and in hospitalised patients. So, the epidemiological situation with the flu and ARVI is a burden for our healthcare system. I would like to note that since the start of November, the situation began to grow worse in many countries in the Northern Hemisphere. Our system of monitoring, of epidemiological oversight sounded the alarm earlier – we identified the first flu viruses in October. The prevailing virus in the Russian Federation is the H1N1 with the addition of 09, because this was a pandemic flu variant in 2009–2010. It appeared in those years for the first time and caused a serious pandemic, especially since at that time we had no vaccine, nor a specific medication or other treatment method. Today, six years after we recorded a high rate in the 2015–2016 season, it returned to Russia, and it prevails over other strains. We identified it in October thanks to our monitoring and scientific research systems. We saw that it completely coincided with the vaccine strain. In other words, what was used to prepare our four Russian vaccines completely blocked this version of the flu virus. Furthermore, this flu virus remained sensitive to the medications produced in Russia against this particular flu virus. (Ms Popova went on to report on the measures taken to protect public health. She talked about the anti-flu vaccination. All vaccines were developed in a timely manner. In the past three months, since September, almost 52 percent of the Russian population has been vaccinated. This is some 75.1 million people, which attests to the high efficiency of the vaccine.)  At the same time, I would like to mention that, like everywhere else in the world, we are recording high activity among viruses with non-influenza etiology. There is a big share of rhinoviruses – about 10 percent. The share of respiratory syncytial viruses is also 10 percent and of metapneumoviruses, 7 percent. Unfortunately, these viruses often cause pneumonia later. The increase in the overall figures for these is not yet typical for Russia, either. The picture is the same in the rest of the world. We have not seen such high levels of these viruses before. This requires a special evaluation methodology and, most importantly, differential diagnosis. It is very important for us today to distinguish between COVID, flu and other viral infections, because the treatment is entirely different. Considering that 90 percent of COVID cases have common ARVI symptoms, it was decided to use the same arrangement we used for COVID testing, to test patients for the flu.  I would like to say a few more words about COVID, which has not gone anywhere and, obviously, is not going anywhere. In November and December, Russia ranked 106 in terms of COVID incidence rate. We are at the same level today. The incidence is actually quite low, or one-fifth of what it was in November 2021, but it still causes concern. Therefore, we continue to perform 250,000–300,000 tests per day. Russia remains among the top ten countries in terms of testing coverage. The COVID-associated risks that we see are the risks of potential variability of the virus, the emergence of new variations in the coronavirus genome, which can cause the situation to worsen. We are monitoring the situation on your instructions, Mr President. For this purpose, a system of genomic surveillance of the virus has been established. More than 220,000 [genomes] have been uploaded to it, and more than 5,000 genomes are added weekly. That is, Russia has a nationwide coronavirus monitoring network. We see no high risks yet. The strains that cause concern in Europe – the so-called BQ1 and BQ1.1 – are practically not found in the Russian Federation. Only isolated cases have been recorded, or less than 1 percent of the total number of tests, while in Spain it is 78 percent, France is almost 60, and Germany 16 percent, but we do not see a significant impact on the epidemiological situation in those countries. On the other hand, there are risks because Russian virologists have not yet proposed specific treatment for this genomic variation today. (Anna Popova also spoke about the establishment of surveillance and epidemiological monitoring in the four new regions of Russia. The situation there is similar to that in the Russian Federation. In addition, Anna Popova pointed out that the upcoming New Year holidays would entail additional risks of the spread and higher incidence of acute viral infections and reported on measures to minimise the risk.) And of course, an awareness raising campaign is an important effort to explain all the rules and precautions to the population. The rules are public knowledge, they are clear, but I believe it is highly important to remind people again. Thank you, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Remember I asked you a few days ago if I should get a jab? You said I should. I am reporting that I got it yesterday. Anna Popova: Thank you very much for that. Vladimir Putin: I also advise all my colleagues to get it. Today I exercised in the morning as usual – everything was just fine, without any problems. <…> Vladimir Putin: (Addressing Viktoria Abramchenko.) Ms Abramchenko, recently you have reported on the work done in your area, and in general mentioned what we are doing as part of our environmental protection plans. We also have big plans to clean up the Volga River basin. There are 60 million people living there, with 45 percent of industrial production and 50 percent of agricultural enterprises concentrated there, and there are quite big plans for it: how many treatment facilities and culverts we need to build there, along a large stretch of the river: more than 1,000 kilometres. What is the current state of this work? Deputy Prime Minister Viktoria Abramchenko: Mr President, colleagues, It is true that the improvement of water bodies is one of our key areas as part of the Ecology national project. Russia ranks second in the world in terms of freshwater reserves after Brazil. This is a key advantage of ours, which influences the development of agriculture, energy, shipping, industry, and, of course, is necessary to create a comfortable environment for our people to live in. At the same time, water bodies are distributed unevenly across the territory of Russia, with nine water-stressed regions and 19 facing constant adverse water impacts. Most of the problems we need to address have to do with bodies of water where the anthropogenic toll is high. As you said, Mr President, out of 2.5 million Russian rivers the Volga bears the heaviest toll. Over 60 million live along the banks of the Volga and its main tributaries, which is a third of Russia’s population. Indeed, 45 percent of our industrial capacity and 50 percent of agricultural enterprises use the Volga. In addition to this, the Volga basin accounts for almost half of the total volume of fresh water used for drinking and household needs. That is, the river suffers from heavy use, and yet 60 million people cannot live without clean Volga water. Therefore, our main task is to reduce the volume of untreated wastewater. The main polluters of the Volga are housing and utility services, which is more than 83 percent; followed by industrial enterprises and agriculture. When we began implementing the project the volume of polluted sewage water from housing and utility services enterprises amounted to more than three billion cubic metres per year. This is approximately 39 percent of the total volume of polluted water from such enterprises across all Russia. We can only counter untreated wastewater by building purification facilities and using closed-cycle water systems at industrial sites. In the three years of implementing this project, we have put into operation 74 treatment facilities in 13 Volga districts. As a result we have exceeded the project’s purification goals. More than 800 million cubic metres of wastewater that flows into the Volga has been filtered. By the end of the year, 35 percent of all effluents discharged by utilities will be cleaned properly.  To check the water quality, we use the monitoring points in the Roshydromet Hydrological Observation Network. There are 67 monitoring points on the Volga River. The water quality of our rivers and lakes fluctuates between conditionally clean, class 1, and extremely dirty, which is class 5. According to Roshydomet, due to the measures taken under the federal project, the number of intake points with class 4, or dirty water, has decreased from 16 to 4 percent on the Volga.  The second area of our work is ensuring the sustainable functioning of the lower Volga water complex. This year, we opened 48 culverts to improve the water exchange in the lower reaches of the Volga, which is 30 percent above our plan. We have cleaned over 141 kilometres of water canals in the mass spawning grounds of the Volga’s eastern delta and have restored almost 77 kilometres of fish-pass canals. To sum up, since the start of the project, we have cleaned 997 kilometres of canals and restored water bodies on over 21,000 hectares. This will make it possible to ensure up to a 50 percent annual increase in fish in the ameliorated spawning grounds of the lower Volga.  Mr President, volunteers and eco-volunteers are making a big contribution to cleaning the shores and basins of water reservoirs. This year, about 1.3 million volunteers have participated in over 21,000 local projects in all regions of the Russian Federation. I would like to thank every participant in these environmental actions. When working on water projects, we should also respond to the risks inherent in global climate change. Climate change is already reducing groundwater levels. This trend is being recorded all over the world and has affected our southern areas. Therefore, it is important not only to clean sewage and prevent the pollution of surface water bodies but also to protect subterranean waters. To do this, we need full systematised information on all drinking water sources – both surface water and groundwater. Mr President, we have started working on a unified state digital registry of drinking water supply sources for the entire country. Rosnedra (Federal Agency for Subsoil Resources Management) has prepared a prototype of such information system. We are now loading the data of the federal executive government bodies and three pilot regions – the Tula Region, the Stavropol Territory and the Chechen Republic – into it. At the same time, we are drafting amendments to legislation that will directly envisage the creation of such state information system. The implementation of the Ecology national project will be completed in 2024. However, to reach the national development goals by 2030, it is necessary to continue taking environmental measures, including the improvement of water bodies. Mr President, with your support, the Government has begun drafting an integrated federal project on the environmental improvement of Russia’s largest water arteries.  We are planning this effort within the basin districts and with consideration for regional peculiarities, and we are paying special attention to cross-border rivers. We are including the entire Volga basin in this project, which means an additional 14 Russian regions. It will also cover the Ural, Irtysh, Don, Terek and Amur rivers and the Baltic basin. The start of the new federal project is scheduled for 2025. It will embrace more water bodies and improve the living standards of at least 80 million people. This concludes my report. Thank you for your attention. Vladimir Putin: Ms Abramchenko, you said the length of the restored water bodies was 997 kilometres. And how many are needed? What is the length of the waterways that must be restored? What is 100 percent?  Viktoria Abramchenko: We have done almost half, Mr President. The lower Volga is a region that was damaged when the Volga-Kama cascade was introduced. Hence, to ensure the functioning of the lower Volga and its ecosystem, to create a normal spawning process, in addition to navigation, we need to dredge and clean these canals – both fish pass canals and the main riverbeds. Vladimir Putin: I think this is more than half, it’s a bit more. Viktoria Abramchenko: As of today, it is 50 percent of what we need. The problem is silting. As watermen say, this is a permanent process, it’s like removing snow. It never ends. Vladimir Putin: It is necessary to continue this work, given the importance of the Volga River to our country. All right.

            "{'date': '2022-12-15T17:20:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues,  As always at the end of the year we are holding a meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects to see what has been done to reach our national goals that are, I must emphasise, the basic, integral guidelines for national development until 2030.  As a key item of our practical agenda, we will discuss today systemic mechanisms for supporting investment in technological projects that ensure Russia’s technological sovereignty, including industrial clusters that I talked about at the St Petersburg Economic Forum, as you will remember. Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Industry Denis Manturov     Manturov DenisDeputy Prime Minister – Industry and Trade Minister  and Head of the State Council Commission on Industry Alexei Dyumin     Dyumin AlexeiGovernor of Tula Region  will make reports on this issue.  But before that, I think it is necessary to outline a number of priority tasks of our national policy for 2023 and to suggest new solutions that will allow us to develop more confidently. In part, they will help us counter the challenges that our economy and our citizens are facing today in the context of the serious, tangible and even tectonic changes that are affecting the entire world. As you know, an unprecedented sanctions aggression has been launched against Russia. It was aimed at crushing our economy, wrecking our national currency – the ruble – by stealing our currency reserves, and provoking a devastating inflation in a short span of time. As we can see – in fact, this is common knowledge – this plan has fallen through. The Russian business community and government bodies worked in a well-coordinated and professional manner and our citizens displayed unity and responsibility. The Government, the Bank of Russia and the Russian regions stabilised the situation by pooling their efforts. The GDP for this year is predicted to fall about 2.5 percent. So there will be a decline, as I already mentioned in public. True, recently I spoke about 2.9 percent, but the latest forecasts put it at a bit less – 2.5 percent. Of course, this is also a decline, but not the crushing 20 percent that many Western, and frankly, our experts forecasted at the time when the collective West hit us with the economic war. Moreover, in the third quarter, the economic dynamics already showed slight growth after the minimal figures of the second quarter. After a serious surge in March-April, the level of prices has actually remained the same since May, while the Russian ruble has become one of the world’s strongest currencies since the start of the year. We achieved this result by making decisions to regulate the capital drain, convert payments for gas into rubles, actively use national currencies in trade with our partners, but primarily, of course, by pursuing a responsible fiscal policy.  Russia’s public finances remain stable. In January-November of this year, the federal budget was executed with a surplus of 560 billion rubles, and the consolidated budget with a surplus of 1.451 trillion rubles. At the same time, in the current and next year, we expect a federal budget deficit of about 2 percent of the GDP, and this will be the best result among the G20 countries. I won’t cite examples at this point. Experts are well aware of the figures on other G20 countries. Moreover, the budget for the next three years provides for a gradual reduction of the deficit to less than one percent of the GDP in 2025.  We will retain our responsible fiscal and macro-economic policy, which will guarantee not only the full funding of social commitments but also the resolution of new tasks facing the country in the next three years. I would like to emphasise that this policy is important not only for countering current challenges but also in the long-term perspective. We will adhere to this policy, focusing our attention on turning it primarily into a firm foundation of economic growth for years ahead. When we discussed the economic situation in the world, we set two main goals for this year: to reduce poverty and inequality, and to continue the development policy. Everyone knows that sanctions are being imposed on us, and that we will certainly only move forward relying above all on our own reserves and resources. Therefore, an important decision was made on monthly payments to families with children aged 8 to 17 years. This decision directly influenced more than 5 million children. This was followed by the advanced indexation of the subsistence minimum, the minimum wage and pension increases of 10 percent. As a result, the poverty rate fell to 10.5 percent in the third quarter. Of course, this is a small drop, but a drop still. The incomes of the poorest part of the population also grew by 27.8 percent in nominal terms – in nominal terms, I want to emphasise this and say again that we are talking about people with the lowest incomes, – which helped to reduce the level of inequality a little. We have kept all the main state programmes, continued to upgrade primary healthcare, relocate people from emergency housing, repair existing and build new roads, eliminate landfills and sites of accumulated environmental damage, build new schools, cultural centres, rural libraries and much more. Moreover, new programmes have been launched, such as the overhaul of schools. This and next year alone, about 3,000 schools will be repaired across Russia. Tools such as infrastructure budget loans and bonds have been made available, which will help the Russian regions attract more than 300 billion rubles this year. We have support programmes and mechanisms for preferential and family mortgages. Loans worth 1.7 trillion rubles were issued under both programmes. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Russian families have improved their living conditions, and construction as sector has become a driver of the Russian economy: up 5.8 percent in ten months. It is expected that this year will be the most successful, a record year for domestic housing construction. We will sum up the final figures a little later. Mr Khusnullin reported to me these figures yesterday or the day before yesterday, and they are impressive. Let’s look at the final results. We will continue developing our country regardless of any foreign pressure. Moreover, we will certainly become stronger, carry out entirely new projects, upgrade Russia’s technology levels and ensure economic, financial, technological and personnel sovereignty. At today’s meeting, and in my speech, I would like to outline six key tasks for 2023 the resolution of which will allow us to move successfully towards reaching our national goals up to 2030. The first task is to take cooperation with our key partners to a new level. We will remove restrictions in logistics and finances for this purpose.  Let me recall that by introducing the sanctions, the Western countries were trying to push Russia to the periphery of world development, but we will never follow a path of self-isolation and autarky, as I have said more than once. On the contrary, we are expanding and will continue to expand our interaction with anyone that is interested, those who clearly understand others’ interests as well as their own interests. Russia is building up trade and investment relations with these countries. Our foreign trade is moving towards dynamic regions and markets and dynamically developing countries. In fact, we have been doing this for many years – even without the current developments in the world. So what has Europe achieved by imposing these restrictions? First, this is what economists call an unprecedented, forced leap of inflation in its own home, the eurozone. In November, inflation in the eurozone averaged 10 percent. Some countries recorded exorbitant figures of more than 20, 21 and 25 percent. Today, the authorities in the European Union are saying themselves that the policy of their main partner – the United States – is directly leading to Europe’s de-industrialisation. They are even trying to present some bills for this to their American suzerain. Sometimes, they even sound offended; they want to know why they deserve this. I’d like to ask them, in this context, and what did you expect? How else should one treat those that allow others to wipe their feet on them? But, after all, this is their business.  I will make a short digression regarding trade relations with the European Union. Despite the sanctions – such a curious thing – over the first nine months of this year, the supply of basic goods from Russia to the EU countries increased by 1.5 times. Aggregate Russian exports increased by 42 percent, and our trade surplus grew 2.3 times, up to US$138 billion. In fact, the European Union continues to consume our goods and services, while holding back the reverse flows. The situation with such imbalances cannot continue indefinitely.  What should we do? We will look for other, more promising partners in actively growing regions of the world economy. These are Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. It is to the markets of friendly countries that we will reorient Russian energy supplies. Thus, over the first nine months of this year, oil exports to partner countries increased by almost a quarter. An important step to reduce the impact of the sanctions and other hostile actions against Russia will be the development of port and pipeline infrastructure in the south and east, including increasing natural gas exports.  Projects such as the Kovykta field, the Power of Siberia 2 and the Far Eastern route will make it possible to increase gas supplies to the east to 48 billion cubic metres by 2025, and to 88 billion cubic metres by 2030. In fact, this is more than 60 percent of gas supplies to the West last year. In turn, the new LNG projects in Yamal will increase the production of liquefied natural gas by 70 billion cubic metres by 2030, which will also help expand the geography of exports. Some of the key growing consumers of Russian gas are our neighbours, including Turkey. Its gas infrastructure has serious potential. In the coming years, we are planning to create, as I already said, a gas hub.  If we talk about creating an electronic platform, this can be done within the next few months. It is there that we will largely determine the final price for our European consumers, because what they have done on their platforms is actually crazy. And now they are still trying to make us feel guilty for what they did themselves, with their own hands. Furthermore, Russia is playing a key role in the global agrarian market. This is the result of work by our agricultural producers, and I would like to thank them very much, to express my most sincere gratitude to them. We are one of the biggest suppliers of grain, vegetable oils and fertilisers to the world. That said, our absolute priority is to meet domestic demand and fulfil in good faith our commitments under our foreign contracts. In the past five months alone, Russia has exported about 22 million tonnes of grain, mostly to Asian and African countries. We are ready to supply another 4 or 5 million tonnes of grain before this year expires. By the end of the agricultural year on June 30, 2023, we will be able to bring our grain exports to 50 million tonnes, considering our record harvest this year. I would like to again congratulate our rural producers on this. We continue exporting mineral fertilisers to world markets. In the 11 months of this year, our exports exceeded 25 million tonnes. Unlike the Western countries that are shamelessly pulling the blanket over themselves, Russia is helping the poorest nations of Africa, Asia and other regions, by supplying them with food and other products. In the next few months, we will be ready to supply the needy countries with about 260,000 tonnes of fertiliser at no charge, as I have said many times. We have already sent 20,000 tonnes of fertiliser to Malawi.  For all the importance of the energy and food sectors, we will primarily focus on non-resource goods and mutual investment in our foreign ties. We consider the development of a convenient and independent payment infrastructure in national currencies to be a firm foundation for promoting international cooperation. We have already made good progress in this respect. According to the latest data, the share of using the Russian ruble in our international transactions has doubled compared to December 2021 reaching one third of all transactions. If we count the use of the currencies of friendly countries, the share is over half. Different payment mechanisms are also on our agenda. I am referring to the use of digital currencies of central banks and the technology of distributed registries that remove the political risks from using the currencies of unfriendly countries.  We are developing reliable and safe transport corridors to help companies establish logistics and cooperation ties. Due to its geographical location and geopolitical opportunities, Russia can protect these logistics corridors against risks. Once again, the foundation lies in both our economic and financial potential, and the capabilities of our law enforcement sector in general. Construction of the Moscow-Kazan motorway continues, which will connect St Petersburg with cities in the Urals and Siberia, including Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk and Tyumen, with a high-quality motorway, and in the long run, with Irkutsk and Vladivostok. The motorway will stretch to Kazakhstan via the city of Togliatti, while providing direct access to Mongolia and China in the east. This will allow us to connect the country’s western and eastern territories more comprehensively; it will connect Russia’s markets to its key partners’ markets and help develop major Eurasian corridors. We are also focusing on the North-South international transport corridor, with plans to expand the transport and logistics infrastructure towards the Caspian Sea. As early as next year, the Volga-Caspian Sea Shipping Canal will allow passage of vessels with a draft of no less than 4.5 metres, which will significantly expand Russia’s routes to the countries in the Middle East and India. We will also focus on developing rail access to the seaports in the Azov and Black Sea basins, and we will boost the port capacities. Our plans include further modernisation of the eastern railway network, mainly the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Baikal-Amur Mainline. This will substantially increase passenger and cargo traffic, boost business activity and social mobility, provide vast opportunities for trade and new projects and, most importantly, help us successfully achieve our ambitious national goals to develop Siberia and the Far East. Meanwhile, we will continue working on such projects as the rapid modernisation of the Murmansk transport hub, the deepening and widening of navigation channels along major rivers and waterways, and construction of the Northern Latitudinal Railway in the period ahead. I would like to emphasize once again that we should ensure comprehensive development of the infrastructure of the Volga region, the Urals, Siberia, Trans-Baikal and the Far East, and focus not solely on seaports and their approach routes but to develop land routes as well. For instance, the city of Chita, with proper federal support, could become a major logistics centre for cooperation with China. Let me add that in early August, the Government approved a plan for developing the Northern Sea Route until 2035. In the near future, this route will see increased traffic as well. We have talked about this many times and are making all necessary efforts to bring this to fruition. This year has shown that promoting cooperation in the EAEU was the right thing to do. I would like to speak separately about this as well. Our economies are developing ties amid global market volatility and an unfavourable global climate. Thus, in the first nine months of this year, the EAEU’s mutual trade increased by almost 12 percent. That said, trade in food and other agricultural products grew by more than one third. Naturally, trade is just a part of Russia’s international relations. We intend to cooperate in science, technology and culture with the same enthusiasm. We are already implementing relevant measures and initiatives. Thus, to streamline the labour market in the EAEU, we launched the Work Without Borders system, which includes over 500,000 vacancies and 2 million CVs from all EAEU countries. We have developed good cooperation in nuclear power engineering. Rosatom creates the entire chain for the construction and operation of nuclear power plants abroad, including on the build-own-operate principle. In the near future, we will expand cooperation on projects in energy, agriculture, industry, aircraft engineering, medicine, transport, outer space, digital technology, environmental protection and other high-tech areas. Together with our partners, we will seek leadership in creating artificial intelligence elements with strict observance of ethical and moral standards. We discussed this issue recently with our colleagues, in particular at a Sber event. Of course, the specific parameters of such cooperation are a subject for discussion but let me repeat – mutual interest is the most important factor in this respect. The second task for 2023 is to enhance technological sovereignty and ensure faster growth of the processing industry. I don’t even know if this is the second or the first task, but if it is the second one, this is only so in terms of figures. In the near future, we will expand joint implementation of energy and agricultural projects.   Sanctions restrictions have confronted our country with many difficult tasks – we have problems with spare parts, a shortage of technological solutions and disrupted logistics. But, on the other hand, this is opening up new opportunities for us, encouraging us to build an economy with full rather than partial technological, production, personnel and scientific sovereignty. Let me stress that it is important not simply to replace certain commodity positions, but to achieve leadership in key, vital areas, such as, as we have already said, artificial intelligence, computing and data transmission, new industrial technologies and others. A number of events and conferences will be held in these areas in the near future, and I will definitely ask members of the Government to take part in them, and I will try to do the same. At the same time, let me remind you that I have already given instructions to prepare and launch new programmes in robotics and aircraft drones in the coming year. Of course, it is impossible to gain technological sovereignty in an instant, as they say: but we need to continue this systemic work for the future. In this context, it is also necessary to expedite the preparation of updated plans for the development of key sectors of the domestic economy, such as the metals industry, the automotive industry, and energy; to adjust plans for the development of the military-industrial complex and the parameters of the state defence order, including considering the results of the work of the Governmental Coordination Council for the material support of the Armed Forces in the special military operation. At the same time, I would like to emphasise that delays and a formal approach are unacceptable here. For example, we have agreed to initiate preferential leasing terms for the domestic production of aircraft and water transport vessels with funding from the National Welfare Fund. Unfortunately, this tool has not yet worked. I would like my colleagues from the Government to focus on implementing this programme in full. The funds for aircraft leasing should be provided as soon as this year, and for water transport vessels no later than the first quarter of 2023. Next year’s task is to ensure the outstripping growth of the processing industry, build up capacities in a short time, and create new production lines. And the key issues here are the availability of raw materials, development and technologies, equipment, qualified personnel and prepared sites. The tool for industrial mortgage loans has already been launched. Now a soft loan of up to 500 million rubles at a rate of 3 to 5 percent for up to seven years can be approved for the purchase of production facilities. I think it would be good to extend this industrial mortgage loan programme beyond acquiring production facilities and use it to construct or upgrade them as well. I would like to draw the Government’s attention to the fact that this mechanism must receive funding. In addition, new preferential terms in industrial clusters will go into effect on January 1. It is designed to complement the existing mechanisms for supporting industrial projects, including the successful operation of the Industrial Development Fund. I would like to emphasise what we have mentioned more than once – the Fund is really doing a good job. It is necessary to reduce the fiscal and administrative burden on residents of industrial clusters. They will also be entitled to low insurance payments and income tax benefits. The demand for their innovative products that are just entering the market will be supported by long-term orders and subsidies from the state. According to estimates, these and other measures should ensure by 2030 the implementation of in-demand projects totalling over 10 trillion rubles. In fact, in 2023 the expected investment in these projects may already reach 2 trillion rubles. Denis Manturov will report in more detail on this issue today. The third task is to ensure the financial sovereignty of our country. Owing to Russia’s solid balance of payments, we do not have to borrow abroad. We do not have to go into bondage and we are not going to do that – our economy has financial resources. We must make them more accessible to the projects of the new economy, for building high-tech enterprises and producing products with high added value.  The work of our financial system must satisfy the requirements that were previously met by Western sources of funding, including trade and project financing. It should ensure the inflow of long-term savings and investment into joint-stock capital and investment in large-scale infrastructure and new production projects. I would like to emphasise that investment in high-tech businesses is particularly important. Next year, we must make tangible progress in all of these areas. I would like to draw the attention of the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Russia to this point. Colleagues, Forward-looking infrastructure development is a vital condition for growing business and investment activity and creating jobs. This is the fourth most important task. We have already achieved good, tangible results in upgrading the federal road network that connects regions and stiches together the space of our enormous country. Our next step is to put regional roads in order. As we recalled literally the day before yesterday, in 2024, no less than 85 percent of roads in our biggest metropolitan areas and over half of regional and municipal roads must be in normal condition. They must become modern and safe. This is what we spoke about at a meeting when we were opening completed transport infrastructure facilities. The pace is good. We have grounds to believe that planned road repair assignments may be completed ahead of schedule. It is important to keep up the pace. The construction and repair of networks, utilities and public transport systems is extensive work carried out at the regional level, including under national projects; we need to pay special attention to this. National project funds are planned until 2024, while some regions are ready to accelerate and put infrastructure into operation a year earlier.  In this regard, I would like to draw your attention to the following. We need to support this initiative. I ask the Government to create an advanced financing mechanism for infrastructure construction under national projects by the end of this year. Okay? It is still necessary to redistribute funds where people are doing well, in the interests of those who are doing this, in order to give the regions access to the financing planned for 2024 as early as next year and thereby shift the plans to the left. Once again, for those who are working successfully and effectively, it is necessary to work, I repeat, ahead of schedule. Further. To develop infrastructure in the regions, we have proposed a new tool – an infrastructure budget loan. It works well: this and next year, they will be used to carry out works worth at least 500 billion rubles.  A decision has already been made to extend this programme for 2024–2025, and additional funds amounting to 500 billion rubles have been allocated. However, this volume, I mean the volume of work, is certainly not enough. Many projects submitted by the regions have not received guaranteed funding, but they – many of them – are already ready for implementation, we can start here and now. I ask the Government to increase infrastructure budget loans next year and allocate an additional 250 billion to develop transport, utilities and social infrastructure, as well as for housing and utilities modernisation programmes.  At the same time, I would like to highlight a few important points.  First. We have launched a programme for developing Far Eastern cities. We have already considered the plans for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. At the beginning of next year, we will discuss plans for developing several more cities. Not all of their needs are financially secured yet. In this regard, I propose allocating a separate limit of 100 billion rubles from the additional 250 billion provided for projects to develop Far Eastern cities. Second. The infrastructure budget loans worth 500 billion rubles, which I already mentioned, were distributed among the regions based on the population, and then the major, most developed and effective projects were selected. I propose an additional limit of 250 billion, which I just mentioned, to be provided also based on an open competition – this includes what I said about Far Eastern cities – based on the greatest social and economic effect. I ask the Government to hold such a competition at the very beginning of next year.  I also think it’s possible to expand the programme of infrastructure bonds. Here, the projects being implemented total 150 billion rubles. I propose doubling this amount in the near future. Next: housing construction and improving people’s living conditions remains one of our unconditional priorities. Here, a special role is to be played by the growing mortgage market, including through programmes co-sponsored by the state. Due to the current economic situation, the number of mortgages, including preferential programmes, has objectively decreased, so we have taken measures to adjust and stabilise this market. After mortgage interest rates spiked in March and April (to 12 percent), I issued instructions to reduce the preferential mortgage rate to 7 percent. This preferential mortgage programme expires on December 31. In this regard, I consider it necessary to take the following decisions. First. As agreed, we will curtail preferential mortgages – we discussed this yesterday, colleagues – we will curtail the programme, but we will do it smoothly. Specifically, I mean we will extend the preferential mortgage programme throughout Russia until July 1, 2024, with a slightly higher interest rate of 8 percent. Second. At the same time, we will expand access to the family mortgage programme, which is becoming our main tool now. At this stage, only families with children born in 2018 or later are entitle to mortgages under this programme. I propose making families with at least two children under 18 entitled to a 6 percent mortgage. This is a new proposal, please consider it as soon as possible and proceed with implementation. Third. I propose a special solution for the new regions in southwestern Russia – the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. I propose a preferential mortgage plan for people living in those new regions of the Russian Federation – 2 percent for new developments, that is, flats in new buildings. It is clear that new construction is nascent in the region right now, so this will be a tool to stimulate growth. True, the volume of housing construction is still limited there, but I believe, and my colleagues agree with this, that a preferential mortgage programme will pave the way for the long-term growth of construction in the new territories. Next. Every house or flat, in every city and village across Russia, all industrial and social facilities must be reliably provided with heat and water. We agreed to launch a major programme to start developing or repairing the public utilities infrastructure in 2023. The plan is to raise at least 4.5 trillion rubles for the programme over the next ten years. The government will contribute 30 billion rubles in 2023 and 100 billion rubles in 2024. However, according to the estimates, this amount is not enough to radically change the situation in the housing and utilities services system. In this regard, I ask the Government, as well as the regions, to make it their priority to allocate infrastructure budget loans to resolve the problems in this area. I also propose discussing the allocation of additional resources for this purpose when drafting the budgets for the forthcoming periods. The growth of the economy and business initiative, industrial and infrastructure opportunities, scientific and technological potential of Russia must create powerful social incentives. This kind of growth should result in a decrease in poverty and inequality, in closing the gap between the regions, and in an increase in the real incomes of citizens. In this regard, colleagues, the next key task is, in fact, critical and cuts across many areas, it concentrates and integrates work everywhere else. Despite the objective difficulties this year, we will achieve positive results in reducing poverty, and next year we need to consolidate this positive trend. We provide targeted support to the most vulnerable groups of people: pensioners, families with children, as well as those in a difficult life situation. Pensions grow annually at a rate higher than inflation. This year, as I have said, they were raised twice, including by an additional ten percent from June 1. At the same time, the subsistence minimum was indexed for the second time this year, and many social benefits and payments are tied to it. They also increased accordingly, directly affecting the income of about 15 million people. I want to stress that the key to increasing the material well-being of Russian families and their incomes is high rates of economic growth. This, of course, is the foundation of all foundations, together with new well-paid jobs, not only in large metropolitan areas and major cities, but also in small cities and towns. Next year ensuring noticeable, tangible growth in real wages must be a priority task for the Government and the regions. The minimum wage is one of the most important indicators. This year it has been increased twice, by 8.6 percent and by 10 percent, and starting next year it will amount to more than 16,000 rubles a month. It is necessary to further increase the minimum wage, doing it at a rate above inflation and average wage growth. People who work should not be poor, struggling to make ends meet. Working must provide them with a decent income. Of course, I am looking forward to hearing your suggestions, colleagues, on possible additional steps in this area. Furthermore, protecting maternity and childhood, supporting families and saving the nation is an absolute, indisputable value for each of us, for the whole country. And this is also the sixth most important task for government bodies at all levels. I would like to note that the so-called children’s budget – and the Finance Ministry has started working in this paradigm as well – is a good idea. The budget allocations for family support measures have increased many times over in the past few years. This is the fastest growing section of our chief financial document – the national budget. Considering the overlapping negative demographic factors, the situation in this area remains complicated. Yes, we managed to overcome the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and reduce the death rate, but the sharp decline in the birth rate has actually reduced these achievements to naught.  I would like to ask the Government to draft a special package of measures to overcome this trend. I realise this is not an easy task for many reasons, but it is necessary to work on it, to change the situation for the better and increase the birth rate and the average life span in Russia. I will note that starting January 1, 2023, as you know, we will consolidate the maternity and child support system – we will launch a uniform monthly allowance for needy families with children from birth to 17 years. This benefit will be allocated based on one application from a parent or a pregnant woman and will be distributed as a single payment for all the children in the family at once. The size of the allowance will be increased to between a half or one subsistence minimum for the able-bodied population in the region of residence. I will repeat that the processing and approval of this allowance must be easy to understand, simple and convenient for people, and, of course, provide real support for families. I would also like to ask you to consider specific life situations. Suppose the income of a family changes because the salary has gone up a bit. In this case, the family loses its eligibility to receive the allowance on technical grounds even though its overall material status has not changed much at all. We need to provide a transitional period for these cases. I have already given instructions on this and am waiting for practical proposals from the Government in the near future.  On a separate note, I would like to briefly go over the healthcare system. Clearly, improvements in public health in previous years made it possible to avoid many negative scenarios from unfolding during the pandemic. I would like to once again thank the healthcare workers for their efforts. We were able to act quickly and make flexible decisions, and to concentrate our efforts and resources where they were most needed. We will continue to follow this approach going forward. Notably, breakthroughs in the healthcare system can be achieved with innovative technology; we have discussed this many times. In this regard, I would like the Ministry of Healthcare to speed up the work on creating individual digital health profiles, to introduce AI and telemedicine technologies in order to improve the quality of medical care, the way it was implemented in Moscow – we discussed this recently as well – and in a number of other regions. Without a doubt, it is important to boost the motivation of healthcare professionals and to tie it to the patients’ condition and improvements in their condition, as well as to their own assessments of the outpatient clinic and hospital performance. As you may be aware, a programme to upgrade primary care started last year. Outpatient clinics and rural health centres are where patients go first to get help, and they base their assessment of the healthcare system’s overall quality on their performance. I would like the leaders of the regions to monitor the progress of this programme. Importantly, an actual increase in the level of satisfaction with medical services rather than dry reports on events or renovations is the main criterion of success. Primary care workers deal with an enormous workload, which is due to personnel shortages, among other things. During the pandemic, senior students and residents helped their colleagues out. I propose making this practice a rule and introducing positions of trainee doctors so that second-year residents could work as specialty doctors, primarily in primary care. In addition, I propose introducing a permanent extra payment for primary care specialist doctors as of January 1, 2023. We have discussed this before. The amount of this payment will range from 4,500 to 18,500 rubles per month. Please note that it should be the same for each specific category of health workers regardless of the region. Reinforcing primary care and building up human potential is extremely important for the prevention and early detection of illnesses and the prevention of risks of premature mortality. Patients with diabetes, for example, are the focus of special attention. There are over 5 million officially diagnosed patients in Russia, and the actual figure is, of course, higher. Since the disease often does not make itself felt, a person may not know they are sick. We already have programmes to counter cardiovascular and oncological diseases and they are producing results. I am asking the Government to launch the same large-scale programme to combat diabetes next year. Ms Golikova knows this, and Mr Dedov talks a lot about this, writes papers, and he sent me the relevant ones. We must respond to this. This work must include early diagnosis of the disease, guaranteed provision of medical products, including consumables and medicines; and, of course, preventive work, that is, the entire range of measures that determine quality of life and life expectancy for people with diabetes. It is also necessary to increase the volume and coverage of drug therapy for patients with hepatitis C. This will make it possible for people to return to a normal, full life, and in most cases make a full recovery. I am asking the Government to work out sources of funding for such a programme. Another thing. A little less than two years ago, the Krug Dobra Foundation was launched in Russia. During this time, over 4,800 children suffering from severe rare diseases received its aid. The foundation pays for extremely expensive medicines for them, as well as expensive treatments, and helps to save lives. Let me remind you that it all started with the purchase of medicines for children diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy, and today the foundation already covers 59 diseases. The list of purchased drugs has almost tripled. Sliding joint prostheses and other medical products previously inaccessible to families are being purchased. Search and delivery of bone marrow for transplantation is underway, including from foreign donor bases. In the near future, the age until which you can receive the foundation’s assistance will be raised – we have discussed this with my colleagues this morning – from 18 to 19 years. I am asking you to do this, to switch to financing further treatment using funds provided for adults for a year after reaching the age of majority, carefully, without any detriment to the patient. We can say confidently that the foundation’s current powers guarantee that all children with serious illnesses can be treated. Its budget can cover this completely – I want to stress this –completely, and it is financed, let me remind you, by raising the tax on part of the income of people who earn more than five million rubles a year. By the way, I would like to address those who pay this tax: all the money is spent exactly as intended. And I would like to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the established indicators of the foundation’s activity and their fulfillment do not mean at all that in the future it will be possible to limit the financing of the foundation. On the contrary, it is necessary to develop and promote the areas of its work. There are resources for this, the Fund has significant amounts of money at its disposal. Earlier today we were counting with Ms Golikova and with the Minister of Finance: over 80 billion rubles will be raised by the end of this year. I also believe it right to use these funds for the health of children, and for this I propose extending the fund’s mandate. It is necessary to provide for the possibility of paying for additional types and volumes of rehabilitative care for sick children at the expense of the foundation. I would like to stress that it is in excess of the volumes provided under the individual rehabilitation programme. Children must be able not only to receive treatment, but also to undergo rehabilitation. In this regard, it is necessary to provide for the payment of expensive technical means of rehabilitation, as well as funds for the development of the musculoskeletal system. In addition to this, the Krug Dobra Foundation will handle the purchase of medicines for children with other serious diseases that are not covered fully now by regional budgets. I am asking the Ministry of Health and Ms Golikova to regulate this. Colleagues, A person’s future success depends on good education and comprehensive development. It is necessary to create opportunities for this everywhere, in every region of our country. We are building kindergartens and schools. By the end of next year, every child under 3 will have a place in a nursery. I will remind you that at the start of this project in 2018, we could only say this for 78 percent of children of this age. At least 1,300 schools will be built and over a million more places will be added between 2019 to 2024. As I have said, we have launched a programme for major repairs on existing schools, and I will repeat that it is necessary to consider the opinions of the teachers, pupils and, of course, the parents in planning such renovations. They know better how everything should work in their own schools. They know what must be done for the educational space to become comfortable and modern and to motivate students for success in their studies. I suggest that after 2024, when the main construction work is completed, we adopt a course towards regular upgrading of education spaces in schools and kindergartens. The aim is to introduce some basic guidelines – make major repairs on schedule, without reminders or orders, purchase educational equipment, and use modern technology and teaching methods.  And, of course, the schools in the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics, and the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions must have the same high standards for equipment in the classrooms, for textbooks, hot meals and for personnel and accessible hobby groups and sports sections. It is very important to use the best, advanced methods in general education in Russia. We have many very strong schools. They have a leading status in world rankings and their students become winners, prize winners in international academic competitions. I suggest – we talk about this all the time – multiplying the experience of such schools in our country. It makes sense to open similar leading schools in every federal district based on these successful schools. They will become flagships, a good example to follow by other schools and a source of best practices, methods and teachers. I propose building one such school in the new regions of the federation. I know that projects like this are nearing completion in Nizhny Novgorod, Pskov, Ryazan, Belgorod and Veliky Novgorod. I would like to ask you to determine which regions these projects should be carried out in and choose a construction funding format. I would ask the Ministry of Education to coordinate this work. Now, on to higher education. In the next decade, Russia plans to develop 25 world class university campuses with top-quality facilities for study and scientific research. More than a million square metres of new facilities will house laboratories and other premises, where more than 25,000 students and young scientists will study and create. These campuses should become centres of attraction for talented young people from all over the country, as well as science development centres and points of economic growth for the regions where these education institutions are located. The first eight projects have already been launched in Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Ufa, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Chelyabinsk and Tomsk. And we certainly need to expedite this work, we need to do it faster. In 2025–2026, nine more campuses will be built in Samara, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Khabarovsk, Perm, Arkhangelsk, Tyumen, Veliky Novgorod, Ivanovo, as well as on the Sirius federal territory. The respective decisions have been made. After that we will select eight more regions that qualify to host new university campuses. The Culture national project includes a wonderful project to create model libraries. They have already become true cultural centres. Recently I had the opportunity to see this, via videoconference. They have become good models in small towns and rural areas. Given the great need for this initiative, I propose allocating additional annual funding for the development of the library network. Let me also remind you that young people aged 14 to 22 can visit museums, theatres, and other cultural events free of charge with the Pushkin Card. This year, which has been declared the Year of Art and Cultural Heritage of the Peoples of Russia, the face value of the Pushkin Card has been increased to 5,000 rubles. In addition, the Government was instructed to implement a new federal programme to modernise the infrastructure for children's recreation and health improvement. I also discussed this with my colleagues this morning. We will launch it next year. Colleagues, All of the above tasks are of particular importance for every city and town and, without exaggeration, every person in our country wherever they may live. Solving these issues imposes stringent, even heightened, demands on public authorities of all levels. Specialists working in this field must set high standards for themselves and the results of their work and, of course, they must be open and receptive to the latest practices, approaches, technologies and methods of work. I spoke about this at a recently held conference on artificial intelligence. I already mentioned this event, I hope you also took note. And now I would like to turn the attention of all my colleagues to the need to focus on improving the quality of public administration, switching to a big data-based governance model, including in healthcare, education, and housing and utilities, as was just mentioned. This is the key to the success of our common work, and the main condition for achieving national development goals. In closing, I would like to mention yet another goal of paramount importance. I mean ensuring security and restoring peaceful life in the Luhansk and Donetsk republics, and the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. We will definitely reach our goal, and these regions will be one with the country in all key aspects of the economy, the social sphere, and governance. We have been down that road with Crimea and Sevastopol before and we know what we need to do. In particular, nationwide social security standards will be introduced in the new regions. A maternity capital programme will be introduced and low-income families will receive payments from the state, pensions will increase, and so on. We will develop primary care and build kindergartens, nurseries and schools. Within a span of several years, the standards of social support, healthcare, education, culture, and transport will be raised to the standard of neighbouring Russian regions. To be sure, we will stimulate economic activity in the new territories and develop their industrial and agricultural potential. It is necessary to increase investment by orders of magnitude, to build new enterprises, including housing construction companies, and to improve the quality of roads and railways, as well as utility and energy infrastructure. I would like the Government to put together, by the end of the first quarter of 2023, a special programme for the socioeconomic development of the new constituent entities of the Federation. All of them should be up to the nationwide standard that regulates the quality of infrastructure, social services and many other parameters that determine quality of life. Please note that this comparatively distant timeline does not in any way mean that this work can be put off. It is important to immediately support the rapid development of the new constituent entities and to show results in each area every year. The relevant ministers and deputy prime ministers will be personally responsible for this. Let us now get down to the agenda.  <…> Vladimir Putin: In conclusion, I would like to, first of all, thank everyone who worked hard to implement all the outlined plans. Let me remind you that we all have worked quite hard to build and prepare them. All this was not done from light-mindedly, but based on calculations, development plans for various industries, and national development goals. This is planned, serious, extensive work, and the implementation of plans within it should guarantee the development of Russia in the most important areas in the economy, in the social sphere, in the field of the country's defence capability, and so on. We have only touched upon some issues that are, of course, of great importance for Russia. I hope that we will continue to work just as effectively. Although now even a superficial analysis of what is happening shows that, as they say in such cases, there is plenty to work on both at the federal centre and at the regional level. And you, colleagues, have just spoken about this in one way or another, and in one way or another touched upon problem areas that need special attention. I hope that it will be so. And in the course of work, as we have just agreed, such proposals have now been voiced, in certain areas we will address these problematic issues on a regular working basis and, if necessary, we will adjust our actions. But on the whole, of course, everything must be done to ensure that the set goals are achieved and all our plans are implemented.  Thank you all very much. All the best.\", 'kremlin_id': 70086, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting of Council for Strategic Development and National Projects', 'teaser': 'The President held a videoconference meeting of the Presidential Council for Strategic Development and National Projects.', 'tags': ['Economy and finance', 'Priority National Projects', 'Social services'], 'transcript_filtered': \"Good afternoon, colleagues, As always at the end of the year we are holding a meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects to see what has been done to reach our national goals that are, I must emphasise, the basic, integral guidelines for national development until 2030.  As a key item of our practical agenda, we will discuss today systemic mechanisms for supporting investment in technological projects that ensure Russia’s technological sovereignty, including industrial clusters that I talked about at the St Petersburg Economic Forum, as you will remember. Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Industry Denis Manturov     Manturov DenisDeputy Prime Minister – Industry and Trade Minister  and Head of the State Council Commission on Industry Alexei Dyumin     Dyumin AlexeiGovernor of Tula Region  will make reports on this issue.  But before that, I think it is necessary to outline a number of priority tasks of our national policy for 2023 and to suggest new solutions that will allow us to develop more confidently. In part, they will help us counter the challenges that our economy and our citizens are facing today in the context of the serious, tangible and even tectonic changes that are affecting the entire world. As you know, an unprecedented sanctions aggression has been launched against Russia. It was aimed at crushing our economy, wrecking our national currency – the ruble – by stealing our currency reserves, and provoking a devastating inflation in a short span of time. As we can see – in fact, this is common knowledge – this plan has fallen through. The Russian business community and government bodies worked in a well-coordinated and professional manner and our citizens displayed unity and responsibility. The Government, the Bank of Russia and the Russian regions stabilised the situation by pooling their efforts. The GDP for this year is predicted to fall about 2.5 percent. So there will be a decline, as I already mentioned in public. True, recently I spoke about 2.9 percent, but the latest forecasts put it at a bit less – 2.5 percent. Of course, this is also a decline, but not the crushing 20 percent that many Western, and frankly, our experts forecasted at the time when the collective West hit us with the economic war. Moreover, in the third quarter, the economic dynamics already showed slight growth after the minimal figures of the second quarter. After a serious surge in March-April, the level of prices has actually remained the same since May, while the Russian ruble has become one of the world’s strongest currencies since the start of the year. We achieved this result by making decisions to regulate the capital drain, convert payments for gas into rubles, actively use national currencies in trade with our partners, but primarily, of course, by pursuing a responsible fiscal policy.  Russia’s public finances remain stable. In January-November of this year, the federal budget was executed with a surplus of 560 billion rubles, and the consolidated budget with a surplus of 1.451 trillion rubles. At the same time, in the current and next year, we expect a federal budget deficit of about 2 percent of the GDP, and this will be the best result among the G20 countries. I won’t cite examples at this point. Experts are well aware of the figures on other G20 countries. Moreover, the budget for the next three years provides for a gradual reduction of the deficit to less than one percent of the GDP in 2025.  We will retain our responsible fiscal and macro-economic policy, which will guarantee not only the full funding of social commitments but also the resolution of new tasks facing the country in the next three years. I would like to emphasise that this policy is important not only for countering current challenges but also in the long-term perspective. We will adhere to this policy, focusing our attention on turning it primarily into a firm foundation of economic growth for years ahead. When we discussed the economic situation in the world, we set two main goals for this year: to reduce poverty and inequality, and to continue the development policy. Everyone knows that sanctions are being imposed on us, and that we will certainly only move forward relying above all on our own reserves and resources. Therefore, an important decision was made on monthly payments to families with children aged 8 to 17 years. This decision directly influenced more than 5 million children. This was followed by the advanced indexation of the subsistence minimum, the minimum wage and pension increases of 10 percent. As a result, the poverty rate fell to 10.5 percent in the third quarter. Of course, this is a small drop, but a drop still. The incomes of the poorest part of the population also grew by 27.8 percent in nominal terms – in nominal terms, I want to emphasise this and say again that we are talking about people with the lowest incomes, – which helped to reduce the level of inequality a little. We have kept all the main state programmes, continued to upgrade primary healthcare, relocate people from emergency housing, repair existing and build new roads, eliminate landfills and sites of accumulated environmental damage, build new schools, cultural centres, rural libraries and much more. Moreover, new programmes have been launched, such as the overhaul of schools. This and next year alone, about 3,000 schools will be repaired across Russia. Tools such as infrastructure budget loans and bonds have been made available, which will help the Russian regions attract more than 300 billion rubles this year. We have support programmes and mechanisms for preferential and family mortgages. Loans worth 1.7 trillion rubles were issued under both programmes. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Russian families have improved their living conditions, and construction as sector has become a driver of the Russian economy: up 5.8 percent in ten months. It is expected that this year will be the most successful, a record year for domestic housing construction. We will sum up the final figures a little later. Mr Khusnullin reported to me these figures yesterday or the day before yesterday, and they are impressive. Let’s look at the final results. We will continue developing our country regardless of any foreign pressure. Moreover, we will certainly become stronger, carry out entirely new projects, upgrade Russia’s technology levels and ensure economic, financial, technological and personnel sovereignty. At today’s meeting, and in my speech, I would like to outline six key tasks for 2023 the resolution of which will allow us to move successfully towards reaching our national goals up to 2030. The first task is to take cooperation with our key partners to a new level. We will remove restrictions in logistics and finances for this purpose.  Let me recall that by introducing the sanctions, the Western countries were trying to push Russia to the periphery of world development, but we will never follow a path of self-isolation and autarky, as I have said more than once. On the contrary, we are expanding and will continue to expand our interaction with anyone that is interested, those who clearly understand others’ interests as well as their own interests. Russia is building up trade and investment relations with these countries. Our foreign trade is moving towards dynamic regions and markets and dynamically developing countries. In fact, we have been doing this for many years – even without the current developments in the world. So what has Europe achieved by imposing these restrictions? First, this is what economists call an unprecedented, forced leap of inflation in its own home, the eurozone. In November, inflation in the eurozone averaged 10 percent. Some countries recorded exorbitant figures of more than 20, 21 and 25 percent. Today, the authorities in the European Union are saying themselves that the policy of their main partner – the United States – is directly leading to Europe’s de-industrialisation. They are even trying to present some bills for this to their American suzerain. Sometimes, they even sound offended; they want to know why they deserve this. I’d like to ask them, in this context, and what did you expect? How else should one treat those that allow others to wipe their feet on them? But, after all, this is their business.  I will make a short digression regarding trade relations with the European Union. Despite the sanctions – such a curious thing – over the first nine months of this year, the supply of basic goods from Russia to the EU countries increased by 1.5 times. Aggregate Russian exports increased by 42 percent, and our trade surplus grew 2.3 times, up to US$138 billion. In fact, the European Union continues to consume our goods and services, while holding back the reverse flows. The situation with such imbalances cannot continue indefinitely.  What should we do? We will look for other, more promising partners in actively growing regions of the world economy. These are Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. It is to the markets of friendly countries that we will reorient Russian energy supplies. Thus, over the first nine months of this year, oil exports to partner countries increased by almost a quarter. An important step to reduce the impact of the sanctions and other hostile actions against Russia will be the development of port and pipeline infrastructure in the south and east, including increasing natural gas exports.  Projects such as the Kovykta field, the Power of Siberia 2 and the Far Eastern route will make it possible to increase gas supplies to the east to 48 billion cubic metres by 2025, and to 88 billion cubic metres by 2030. In fact, this is more than 60 percent of gas supplies to the West last year. In turn, the new LNG projects in Yamal will increase the production of liquefied natural gas by 70 billion cubic metres by 2030, which will also help expand the geography of exports. Some of the key growing consumers of Russian gas are our neighbours, including Turkey. Its gas infrastructure has serious potential. In the coming years, we are planning to create, as I already said, a gas hub.  If we talk about creating an electronic platform, this can be done within the next few months. It is there that we will largely determine the final price for our European consumers, because what they have done on their platforms is actually crazy. And now they are still trying to make us feel guilty for what they did themselves, with their own hands. Furthermore, Russia is playing a key role in the global agrarian market. This is the result of work by our agricultural producers, and I would like to thank them very much, to express my most sincere gratitude to them. We are one of the biggest suppliers of grain, vegetable oils and fertilisers to the world. That said, our absolute priority is to meet domestic demand and fulfil in good faith our commitments under our foreign contracts. In the past five months alone, Russia has exported about 22 million tonnes of grain, mostly to Asian and African countries. We are ready to supply another 4 or 5 million tonnes of grain before this year expires. By the end of the agricultural year on June 30, 2023, we will be able to bring our grain exports to 50 million tonnes, considering our record harvest this year. I would like to again congratulate our rural producers on this. We continue exporting mineral fertilisers to world markets. In the 11 months of this year, our exports exceeded 25 million tonnes. Unlike the Western countries that are shamelessly pulling the blanket over themselves, Russia is helping the poorest nations of Africa, Asia and other regions, by supplying them with food and other products. In the next few months, we will be ready to supply the needy countries with about 260,000 tonnes of fertiliser at no charge, as I have said many times. We have already sent 20,000 tonnes of fertiliser to Malawi.  For all the importance of the energy and food sectors, we will primarily focus on non-resource goods and mutual investment in our foreign ties. We consider the development of a convenient and independent payment infrastructure in national currencies to be a firm foundation for promoting international cooperation. We have already made good progress in this respect. According to the latest data, the share of using the Russian ruble in our international transactions has doubled compared to December 2021 reaching one third of all transactions. If we count the use of the currencies of friendly countries, the share is over half. Different payment mechanisms are also on our agenda. I am referring to the use of digital currencies of central banks and the technology of distributed registries that remove the political risks from using the currencies of unfriendly countries.  We are developing reliable and safe transport corridors to help companies establish logistics and cooperation ties. Due to its geographical location and geopolitical opportunities, Russia can protect these logistics corridors against risks. Once again, the foundation lies in both our economic and financial potential, and the capabilities of our law enforcement sector in general. Construction of the Moscow-Kazan motorway continues, which will connect St Petersburg with cities in the Urals and Siberia, including Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk and Tyumen, with a high-quality motorway, and in the long run, with Irkutsk and Vladivostok. The motorway will stretch to Kazakhstan via the city of Togliatti, while providing direct access to Mongolia and China in the east. This will allow us to connect the country’s western and eastern territories more comprehensively; it will connect Russia’s markets to its key partners’ markets and help develop major Eurasian corridors. We are also focusing on the North-South international transport corridor, with plans to expand the transport and logistics infrastructure towards the Caspian Sea. As early as next year, the Volga-Caspian Sea Shipping Canal will allow passage of vessels with a draft of no less than 4.5 metres, which will significantly expand Russia’s routes to the countries in the Middle East and India. We will also focus on developing rail access to the seaports in the Azov and Black Sea basins, and we will boost the port capacities. Our plans include further modernisation of the eastern railway network, mainly the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Baikal-Amur Mainline. This will substantially increase passenger and cargo traffic, boost business activity and social mobility, provide vast opportunities for trade and new projects and, most importantly, help us successfully achieve our ambitious national goals to develop Siberia and the Far East. Meanwhile, we will continue working on such projects as the rapid modernisation of the Murmansk transport hub, the deepening and widening of navigation channels along major rivers and waterways, and construction of the Northern Latitudinal Railway in the period ahead. I would like to emphasize once again that we should ensure comprehensive development of the infrastructure of the Volga region, the Urals, Siberia, Trans-Baikal and the Far East, and focus not solely on seaports and their approach routes but to develop land routes as well. For instance, the city of Chita, with proper federal support, could become a major logistics centre for cooperation with China. Let me add that in early August, the Government approved a plan for developing the Northern Sea Route until 2035. In the near future, this route will see increased traffic as well. We have talked about this many times and are making all necessary efforts to bring this to fruition. This year has shown that promoting cooperation in the EAEU was the right thing to do. I would like to speak separately about this as well. Our economies are developing ties amid global market volatility and an unfavourable global climate. Thus, in the first nine months of this year, the EAEU’s mutual trade increased by almost 12 percent. That said, trade in food and other agricultural products grew by more than one third. Naturally, trade is just a part of Russia’s international relations. We intend to cooperate in science, technology and culture with the same enthusiasm. We are already implementing relevant measures and initiatives. Thus, to streamline the labour market in the EAEU, we launched the Work Without Borders system, which includes over 500,000 vacancies and 2 million CVs from all EAEU countries. We have developed good cooperation in nuclear power engineering. Rosatom creates the entire chain for the construction and operation of nuclear power plants abroad, including on the build-own-operate principle. In the near future, we will expand cooperation on projects in energy, agriculture, industry, aircraft engineering, medicine, transport, outer space, digital technology, environmental protection and other high-tech areas. Together with our partners, we will seek leadership in creating artificial intelligence elements with strict observance of ethical and moral standards. We discussed this issue recently with our colleagues, in particular at a Sber event. Of course, the specific parameters of such cooperation are a subject for discussion but let me repeat – mutual interest is the most important factor in this respect. The second task for 2023 is to enhance technological sovereignty and ensure faster growth of the processing industry. I don’t even know if this is the second or the first task, but if it is the second one, this is only so in terms of figures. In the near future, we will expand joint implementation of energy and agricultural projects.   Sanctions restrictions have confronted our country with many difficult tasks – we have problems with spare parts, a shortage of technological solutions and disrupted logistics. But, on the other hand, this is opening up new opportunities for us, encouraging us to build an economy with full rather than partial technological, production, personnel and scientific sovereignty. Let me stress that it is important not simply to replace certain commodity positions, but to achieve leadership in key, vital areas, such as, as we have already said, artificial intelligence, computing and data transmission, new industrial technologies and others. A number of events and conferences will be held in these areas in the near future, and I will definitely ask members of the Government to take part in them, and I will try to do the same. At the same time, let me remind you that I have already given instructions to prepare and launch new programmes in robotics and aircraft drones in the coming year. Of course, it is impossible to gain technological sovereignty in an instant, as they say: but we need to continue this systemic work for the future. In this context, it is also necessary to expedite the preparation of updated plans for the development of key sectors of the domestic economy, such as the metals industry, the automotive industry, and energy; to adjust plans for the development of the military-industrial complex and the parameters of the state defence order, including considering the results of the work of the Governmental Coordination Council for the material support of the Armed Forces in the special military operation. At the same time, I would like to emphasise that delays and a formal approach are unacceptable here. For example, we have agreed to initiate preferential leasing terms for the domestic production of aircraft and water transport vessels with funding from the National Welfare Fund. Unfortunately, this tool has not yet worked. I would like my colleagues from the Government to focus on implementing this programme in full. The funds for aircraft leasing should be provided as soon as this year, and for water transport vessels no later than the first quarter of 2023. Next year’s task is to ensure the outstripping growth of the processing industry, build up capacities in a short time, and create new production lines. And the key issues here are the availability of raw materials, development and technologies, equipment, qualified personnel and prepared sites. The tool for industrial mortgage loans has already been launched. Now a soft loan of up to 500 million rubles at a rate of 3 to 5 percent for up to seven years can be approved for the purchase of production facilities. I think it would be good to extend this industrial mortgage loan programme beyond acquiring production facilities and use it to construct or upgrade them as well. I would like to draw the Government’s attention to the fact that this mechanism must receive funding. In addition, new preferential terms in industrial clusters will go into effect on January 1. It is designed to complement the existing mechanisms for supporting industrial projects, including the successful operation of the Industrial Development Fund. I would like to emphasise what we have mentioned more than once – the Fund is really doing a good job. It is necessary to reduce the fiscal and administrative burden on residents of industrial clusters. They will also be entitled to low insurance payments and income tax benefits. The demand for their innovative products that are just entering the market will be supported by long-term orders and subsidies from the state. According to estimates, these and other measures should ensure by 2030 the implementation of in-demand projects totalling over 10 trillion rubles. In fact, in 2023 the expected investment in these projects may already reach 2 trillion rubles. Denis Manturov will report in more detail on this issue today. The third task is to ensure the financial sovereignty of our country. Owing to Russia’s solid balance of payments, we do not have to borrow abroad. We do not have to go into bondage and we are not going to do that – our economy has financial resources. We must make them more accessible to the projects of the new economy, for building high-tech enterprises and producing products with high added value.  The work of our financial system must satisfy the requirements that were previously met by Western sources of funding, including trade and project financing. It should ensure the inflow of long-term savings and investment into joint-stock capital and investment in large-scale infrastructure and new production projects. I would like to emphasise that investment in high-tech businesses is particularly important. Next year, we must make tangible progress in all of these areas. I would like to draw the attention of the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Russia to this point. Colleagues, Forward-looking infrastructure development is a vital condition for growing business and investment activity and creating jobs. This is the fourth most important task. We have already achieved good, tangible results in upgrading the federal road network that connects regions and stiches together the space of our enormous country. Our next step is to put regional roads in order. As we recalled literally the day before yesterday, in 2024, no less than 85 percent of roads in our biggest metropolitan areas and over half of regional and municipal roads must be in normal condition. They must become modern and safe. This is what we spoke about at a meeting when we were opening completed transport infrastructure facilities. The pace is good. We have grounds to believe that planned road repair assignments may be completed ahead of schedule. It is important to keep up the pace. The construction and repair of networks, utilities and public transport systems is extensive work carried out at the regional level, including under national projects; we need to pay special attention to this. National project funds are planned until 2024, while some regions are ready to accelerate and put infrastructure into operation a year earlier.  In this regard, I would like to draw your attention to the following. We need to support this initiative. I ask the Government to create an advanced financing mechanism for infrastructure construction under national projects by the end of this year. Okay? It is still necessary to redistribute funds where people are doing well, in the interests of those who are doing this, in order to give the regions access to the financing planned for 2024 as early as next year and thereby shift the plans to the left. Once again, for those who are working successfully and effectively, it is necessary to work, I repeat, ahead of schedule. Further. To develop infrastructure in the regions, we have proposed a new tool – an infrastructure budget loan. It works well: this and next year, they will be used to carry out works worth at least 500 billion rubles.  A decision has already been made to extend this programme for 2024–2025, and additional funds amounting to 500 billion rubles have been allocated. However, this volume, I mean the volume of work, is certainly not enough. Many projects submitted by the regions have not received guaranteed funding, but they – many of them – are already ready for implementation, we can start here and now. I ask the Government to increase infrastructure budget loans next year and allocate an additional 250 billion to develop transport, utilities and social infrastructure, as well as for housing and utilities modernisation programmes.  At the same time, I would like to highlight a few important points.  First. We have launched a programme for developing Far Eastern cities. We have already considered the plans for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. At the beginning of next year, we will discuss plans for developing several more cities. Not all of their needs are financially secured yet. In this regard, I propose allocating a separate limit of 100 billion rubles from the additional 250 billion provided for projects to develop Far Eastern cities. Second. The infrastructure budget loans worth 500 billion rubles, which I already mentioned, were distributed among the regions based on the population, and then the major, most developed and effective projects were selected. I propose an additional limit of 250 billion, which I just mentioned, to be provided also based on an open competition – this includes what I said about Far Eastern cities – based on the greatest social and economic effect. I ask the Government to hold such a competition at the very beginning of next year.  I also think it’s possible to expand the programme of infrastructure bonds. Here, the projects being implemented total 150 billion rubles. I propose doubling this amount in the near future. Next: housing construction and improving people’s living conditions remains one of our unconditional priorities. Here, a special role is to be played by the growing mortgage market, including through programmes co-sponsored by the state. Due to the current economic situation, the number of mortgages, including preferential programmes, has objectively decreased, so we have taken measures to adjust and stabilise this market. After mortgage interest rates spiked in March and April (to 12 percent), I issued instructions to reduce the preferential mortgage rate to 7 percent. This preferential mortgage programme expires on December 31. In this regard, I consider it necessary to take the following decisions. First. As agreed, we will curtail preferential mortgages – we discussed this yesterday, colleagues – we will curtail the programme, but we will do it smoothly. Specifically, I mean we will extend the preferential mortgage programme throughout Russia until July 1, 2024, with a slightly higher interest rate of 8 percent. Second. At the same time, we will expand access to the family mortgage programme, which is becoming our main tool now. At this stage, only families with children born in 2018 or later are entitle to mortgages under this programme. I propose making families with at least two children under 18 entitled to a 6 percent mortgage. This is a new proposal, please consider it as soon as possible and proceed with implementation. Third. I propose a special solution for the new regions in southwestern Russia – the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. I propose a preferential mortgage plan for people living in those new regions of the Russian Federation – 2 percent for new developments, that is, flats in new buildings. It is clear that new construction is nascent in the region right now, so this will be a tool to stimulate growth. True, the volume of housing construction is still limited there, but I believe, and my colleagues agree with this, that a preferential mortgage programme will pave the way for the long-term growth of construction in the new territories. Next. Every house or flat, in every city and village across Russia, all industrial and social facilities must be reliably provided with heat and water. We agreed to launch a major programme to start developing or repairing the public utilities infrastructure in 2023. The plan is to raise at least 4.5 trillion rubles for the programme over the next ten years. The government will contribute 30 billion rubles in 2023 and 100 billion rubles in 2024. However, according to the estimates, this amount is not enough to radically change the situation in the housing and utilities services system. In this regard, I ask the Government, as well as the regions, to make it their priority to allocate infrastructure budget loans to resolve the problems in this area. I also propose discussing the allocation of additional resources for this purpose when drafting the budgets for the forthcoming periods. The growth of the economy and business initiative, industrial and infrastructure opportunities, scientific and technological potential of Russia must create powerful social incentives. This kind of growth should result in a decrease in poverty and inequality, in closing the gap between the regions, and in an increase in the real incomes of citizens. In this regard, colleagues, the next key task is, in fact, critical and cuts across many areas, it concentrates and integrates work everywhere else. Despite the objective difficulties this year, we will achieve positive results in reducing poverty, and next year we need to consolidate this positive trend. We provide targeted support to the most vulnerable groups of people: pensioners, families with children, as well as those in a difficult life situation. Pensions grow annually at a rate higher than inflation. This year, as I have said, they were raised twice, including by an additional ten percent from June 1. At the same time, the subsistence minimum was indexed for the second time this year, and many social benefits and payments are tied to it. They also increased accordingly, directly affecting the income of about 15 million people. I want to stress that the key to increasing the material well-being of Russian families and their incomes is high rates of economic growth. This, of course, is the foundation of all foundations, together with new well-paid jobs, not only in large metropolitan areas and major cities, but also in small cities and towns. Next year ensuring noticeable, tangible growth in real wages must be a priority task for the Government and the regions. The minimum wage is one of the most important indicators. This year it has been increased twice, by 8.6 percent and by 10 percent, and starting next year it will amount to more than 16,000 rubles a month. It is necessary to further increase the minimum wage, doing it at a rate above inflation and average wage growth. People who work should not be poor, struggling to make ends meet. Working must provide them with a decent income. Of course, I am looking forward to hearing your suggestions, colleagues, on possible additional steps in this area. Furthermore, protecting maternity and childhood, supporting families and saving the nation is an absolute, indisputable value for each of us, for the whole country. And this is also the sixth most important task for government bodies at all levels. I would like to note that the so-called children’s budget – and the Finance Ministry has started working in this paradigm as well – is a good idea. The budget allocations for family support measures have increased many times over in the past few years. This is the fastest growing section of our chief financial document – the national budget. Considering the overlapping negative demographic factors, the situation in this area remains complicated. Yes, we managed to overcome the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and reduce the death rate, but the sharp decline in the birth rate has actually reduced these achievements to naught.  I would like to ask the Government to draft a special package of measures to overcome this trend. I realise this is not an easy task for many reasons, but it is necessary to work on it, to change the situation for the better and increase the birth rate and the average life span in Russia. I will note that starting January 1, 2023, as you know, we will consolidate the maternity and child support system – we will launch a uniform monthly allowance for needy families with children from birth to 17 years. This benefit will be allocated based on one application from a parent or a pregnant woman and will be distributed as a single payment for all the children in the family at once. The size of the allowance will be increased to between a half or one subsistence minimum for the able-bodied population in the region of residence. I will repeat that the processing and approval of this allowance must be easy to understand, simple and convenient for people, and, of course, provide real support for families. I would also like to ask you to consider specific life situations. Suppose the income of a family changes because the salary has gone up a bit. In this case, the family loses its eligibility to receive the allowance on technical grounds even though its overall material status has not changed much at all. We need to provide a transitional period for these cases. I have already given instructions on this and am waiting for practical proposals from the Government in the near future.  On a separate note, I would like to briefly go over the healthcare system. Clearly, improvements in public health in previous years made it possible to avoid many negative scenarios from unfolding during the pandemic. I would like to once again thank the healthcare workers for their efforts. We were able to act quickly and make flexible decisions, and to concentrate our efforts and resources where they were most needed. We will continue to follow this approach going forward. Notably, breakthroughs in the healthcare system can be achieved with innovative technology; we have discussed this many times. In this regard, I would like the Ministry of Healthcare to speed up the work on creating individual digital health profiles, to introduce AI and telemedicine technologies in order to improve the quality of medical care, the way it was implemented in Moscow – we discussed this recently as well – and in a number of other regions. Without a doubt, it is important to boost the motivation of healthcare professionals and to tie it to the patients’ condition and improvements in their condition, as well as to their own assessments of the outpatient clinic and hospital performance. As you may be aware, a programme to upgrade primary care started last year. Outpatient clinics and rural health centres are where patients go first to get help, and they base their assessment of the healthcare system’s overall quality on their performance. I would like the leaders of the regions to monitor the progress of this programme. Importantly, an actual increase in the level of satisfaction with medical services rather than dry reports on events or renovations is the main criterion of success. Primary care workers deal with an enormous workload, which is due to personnel shortages, among other things. During the pandemic, senior students and residents helped their colleagues out. I propose making this practice a rule and introducing positions of trainee doctors so that second-year residents could work as specialty doctors, primarily in primary care. In addition, I propose introducing a permanent extra payment for primary care specialist doctors as of January 1, 2023. We have discussed this before. The amount of this payment will range from 4,500 to 18,500 rubles per month. Please note that it should be the same for each specific category of health workers regardless of the region. Reinforcing primary care and building up human potential is extremely important for the prevention and early detection of illnesses and the prevention of risks of premature mortality. Patients with diabetes, for example, are the focus of special attention. There are over 5 million officially diagnosed patients in Russia, and the actual figure is, of course, higher. Since the disease often does not make itself felt, a person may not know they are sick. We already have programmes to counter cardiovascular and oncological diseases and they are producing results. I am asking the Government to launch the same large-scale programme to combat diabetes next year. Ms Golikova knows this, and Mr Dedov talks a lot about this, writes papers, and he sent me the relevant ones. We must respond to this. This work must include early diagnosis of the disease, guaranteed provision of medical products, including consumables and medicines; and, of course, preventive work, that is, the entire range of measures that determine quality of life and life expectancy for people with diabetes. It is also necessary to increase the volume and coverage of drug therapy for patients with hepatitis C. This will make it possible for people to return to a normal, full life, and in most cases make a full recovery. I am asking the Government to work out sources of funding for such a programme. Another thing. A little less than two years ago, the Krug Dobra Foundation was launched in Russia. During this time, over 4,800 children suffering from severe rare diseases received its aid. The foundation pays for extremely expensive medicines for them, as well as expensive treatments, and helps to save lives. Let me remind you that it all started with the purchase of medicines for children diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy, and today the foundation already covers 59 diseases. The list of purchased drugs has almost tripled. Sliding joint prostheses and other medical products previously inaccessible to families are being purchased. Search and delivery of bone marrow for transplantation is underway, including from foreign donor bases. In the near future, the age until which you can receive the foundation’s assistance will be raised – we have discussed this with my colleagues this morning – from 18 to 19 years. I am asking you to do this, to switch to financing further treatment using funds provided for adults for a year after reaching the age of majority, carefully, without any detriment to the patient. We can say confidently that the foundation’s current powers guarantee that all children with serious illnesses can be treated. Its budget can cover this completely – I want to stress this –completely, and it is financed, let me remind you, by raising the tax on part of the income of people who earn more than five million rubles a year. By the way, I would like to address those who pay this tax: all the money is spent exactly as intended. And I would like to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the established indicators of the foundation’s activity and their fulfillment do not mean at all that in the future it will be possible to limit the financing of the foundation. On the contrary, it is necessary to develop and promote the areas of its work. There are resources for this, the Fund has significant amounts of money at its disposal. Earlier today we were counting with Ms Golikova and with the Minister of Finance: over 80 billion rubles will be raised by the end of this year. I also believe it right to use these funds for the health of children, and for this I propose extending the fund’s mandate. It is necessary to provide for the possibility of paying for additional types and volumes of rehabilitative care for sick children at the expense of the foundation. I would like to stress that it is in excess of the volumes provided under the individual rehabilitation programme. Children must be able not only to receive treatment, but also to undergo rehabilitation. In this regard, it is necessary to provide for the payment of expensive technical means of rehabilitation, as well as funds for the development of the musculoskeletal system. In addition to this, the Krug Dobra Foundation will handle the purchase of medicines for children with other serious diseases that are not covered fully now by regional budgets. I am asking the Ministry of Health and Ms Golikova to regulate this. Colleagues, A person’s future success depends on good education and comprehensive development. It is necessary to create opportunities for this everywhere, in every region of our country. We are building kindergartens and schools. By the end of next year, every child under 3 will have a place in a nursery. I will remind you that at the start of this project in 2018, we could only say this for 78 percent of children of this age. At least 1,300 schools will be built and over a million more places will be added between 2019 to 2024. As I have said, we have launched a programme for major repairs on existing schools, and I will repeat that it is necessary to consider the opinions of the teachers, pupils and, of course, the parents in planning such renovations. They know better how everything should work in their own schools. They know what must be done for the educational space to become comfortable and modern and to motivate students for success in their studies. I suggest that after 2024, when the main construction work is completed, we adopt a course towards regular upgrading of education spaces in schools and kindergartens. The aim is to introduce some basic guidelines – make major repairs on schedule, without reminders or orders, purchase educational equipment, and use modern technology and teaching methods.  And, of course, the schools in the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics, and the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions must have the same high standards for equipment in the classrooms, for textbooks, hot meals and for personnel and accessible hobby groups and sports sections. It is very important to use the best, advanced methods in general education in Russia. We have many very strong schools. They have a leading status in world rankings and their students become winners, prize winners in international academic competitions. I suggest – we talk about this all the time – multiplying the experience of such schools in our country. It makes sense to open similar leading schools in every federal district based on these successful schools. They will become flagships, a good example to follow by other schools and a source of best practices, methods and teachers. I propose building one such school in the new regions of the federation. I know that projects like this are nearing completion in Nizhny Novgorod, Pskov, Ryazan, Belgorod and Veliky Novgorod. I would like to ask you to determine which regions these projects should be carried out in and choose a construction funding format. I would ask the Ministry of Education to coordinate this work. Now, on to higher education. In the next decade, Russia plans to develop 25 world class university campuses with top-quality facilities for study and scientific research. More than a million square metres of new facilities will house laboratories and other premises, where more than 25,000 students and young scientists will study and create. These campuses should become centres of attraction for talented young people from all over the country, as well as science development centres and points of economic growth for the regions where these education institutions are located. The first eight projects have already been launched in Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Ufa, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Chelyabinsk and Tomsk. And we certainly need to expedite this work, we need to do it faster. In 2025–2026, nine more campuses will be built in Samara, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Khabarovsk, Perm, Arkhangelsk, Tyumen, Veliky Novgorod, Ivanovo, as well as on the Sirius federal territory. The respective decisions have been made. After that we will select eight more regions that qualify to host new university campuses. The Culture national project includes a wonderful project to create model libraries. They have already become true cultural centres. Recently I had the opportunity to see this, via videoconference. They have become good models in small towns and rural areas. Given the great need for this initiative, I propose allocating additional annual funding for the development of the library network. Let me also remind you that young people aged 14 to 22 can visit museums, theatres, and other cultural events free of charge with the Pushkin Card. This year, which has been declared the Year of Art and Cultural Heritage of the Peoples of Russia, the face value of the Pushkin Card has been increased to 5,000 rubles. In addition, the Government was instructed to implement a new federal programme to modernise the infrastructure for children's recreation and health improvement. I also discussed this with my colleagues this morning. We will launch it next year. Colleagues, All of the above tasks are of particular importance for every city and town and, without exaggeration, every person in our country wherever they may live. Solving these issues imposes stringent, even heightened, demands on public authorities of all levels. Specialists working in this field must set high standards for themselves and the results of their work and, of course, they must be open and receptive to the latest practices, approaches, technologies and methods of work. I spoke about this at a recently held conference on artificial intelligence. I already mentioned this event, I hope you also took note. And now I would like to turn the attention of all my colleagues to the need to focus on improving the quality of public administration, switching to a big data-based governance model, including in healthcare, education, and housing and utilities, as was just mentioned. This is the key to the success of our common work, and the main condition for achieving national development goals. In closing, I would like to mention yet another goal of paramount importance. I mean ensuring security and restoring peaceful life in the Luhansk and Donetsk republics, and the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. We will definitely reach our goal, and these regions will be one with the country in all key aspects of the economy, the social sphere, and governance. We have been down that road with Crimea and Sevastopol before and we know what we need to do. In particular, nationwide social security standards will be introduced in the new regions. A maternity capital programme will be introduced and low-income families will receive payments from the state, pensions will increase, and so on. We will develop primary care and build kindergartens, nurseries and schools. Within a span of several years, the standards of social support, healthcare, education, culture, and transport will be raised to the standard of neighbouring Russian regions. To be sure, we will stimulate economic activity in the new territories and develop their industrial and agricultural potential. It is necessary to increase investment by orders of magnitude, to build new enterprises, including housing construction companies, and to improve the quality of roads and railways, as well as utility and energy infrastructure. I would like the Government to put together, by the end of the first quarter of 2023, a special programme for the socioeconomic development of the new constituent entities of the Federation. All of them should be up to the nationwide standard that regulates the quality of infrastructure, social services and many other parameters that determine quality of life. Please note that this comparatively distant timeline does not in any way mean that this work can be put off. It is important to immediately support the rapid development of the new constituent entities and to show results in each area every year. The relevant ministers and deputy prime ministers will be personally responsible for this. Let us now get down to the agenda.  <…> In conclusion, I would like to, first of all, thank everyone who worked hard to implement all the outlined plans. Let me remind you that we all have worked quite hard to build and prepare them. All this was not done from light-mindedly, but based on calculations, development plans for various industries, and national development goals. This is planned, serious, extensive work, and the implementation of plans within it should guarantee the development of Russia in the most important areas in the economy, in the social sphere, in the field of the country's defence capability, and so on. We have only touched upon some issues that are, of course, of great importance for Russia. I hope that we will continue to work just as effectively. Although now even a superficial analysis of what is happening shows that, as they say in such cases, there is plenty to work on both at the federal centre and at the regional level. And you, colleagues, have just spoken about this in one way or another, and in one way or another touched upon problem areas that need special attention. I hope that it will be so. And in the course of work, as we have just agreed, such proposals have now been voiced, in certain areas we will address these problematic issues on a regular working basis and, if necessary, we will adjust our actions. But on the whole, of course, everything must be done to ensure that the set goals are achieved and all our plans are implemented.  Thank you all very much.

And now it is up to all of you to collectively decide what your movement should be like, what needs to be done to make it truly interesting and attractive to your peers, and to define its name and programme. The idea, which you, as children and teenagers, have become the authors of – to create this movement – was conceived less than a year ago. And it is remarkable that you have managed to implement this idea which is needed both for you and the country as a whole, so quickly, in a coordinated manner, and from scratch. It is my wish that you keep dreaming, creating, and proposing your own projects, that you mimic no one, and come up with and bring to life something of your own and – if required – stand your ground without any hesitation, yet that you be able to learn to listen to objections and place value on constructive criticism and advice. I would like to emphasise once again: the movement should, both now and moving forward, be built around your interests and hobbies. This is the principal idea: to become a modern space available in every corner of the country – in big cities and small settlements – where each child, teenager, and young adult will have all the necessary tools and opportunities for self-accomplishment.

They were followed by a bilateral conversation between the leaders of Russia and Belarus.  * * * Beginning of Russian-Belarusian talks President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko     Lukashenko AlexanderPresident of Belarus : Mr Putin, friends, Allow me to cordially welcome you, all of my Russian colleagues, to the hospitable Belarusian capital. By force of circumstances, you, as this group, did not come to see us for a long time, but our respective ministers meet often. You are always welcome guests for us. The break in visits to Minsk did not prevent us from remaining in constant contact. Even our so-called Western partners were very worried about us getting together so often. We met regularly both in the Russian Federation and at international venues. Our governments are working hard as well, and many meetings are held at the level of regions and companies which is seen in the steady growth of trade figures and resolution of many issues that previously hindered our cooperation. The strengthening of Belarusian-Russian ties has become a natural response to the changing situation in the world, where our resilience is being constantly tested. I believe that despite certain irregularities, we are still able to find effective answers to various challenges and threats. Landmark decisions about closer integration of our states once again show the world at large that pandemics, crises or sanctions can be overcome only if we stand united. As Mr Putin and I often say, Russia and Belarus are open to dialogue with other countries, including European countries. I hope that they will soon heed the voice of reason, and we will begin a constructive discussion of security for all and the future international order.  Protecting democracy and progress with restrictions and military force used against our states no longer impresses even local voters who have felt in full measure the shortcomings of this policy. Hard times make us show political will and focus on results regarding all items on the bilateral visit’s agenda. This is our answer. Our success in this work will determine the spot our countries will have tomorrow in the new system of international coordinates. We must avoid at all costs the mistakes that were made after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Providing solutions to sensitive economic issues that stand between people and prosperity and ultimately determine the people’s support for our public and political reforms is our unconditional priority. Our joint steps made it possible to overcome potential problems caused by the sanctions pressure. Specialists from Belarus and Russia have done a good job drafting Union programmes, which the President of Russia and I approved some time ago. There are breakthroughs in almost all areas, but so far not everything has worked out the way we wanted it to, which is holding back our progress. You are aware that our respective governments are telling us that they have exhausted negotiations with regard to a number of sensitive issues. They reported to us that the parties had formulated their positions, and today we will discuss these positions again during an expanded meeting. The governments believe that without you, Mr Putin, and me they will not be able to come to an agreement on certain issues. That is why we convened this meeting today. Well, let us once again have an in-depth discussion and make appropriate political decisions, if need be. President Putin and I meet quite often. Truth be told, we have discussed all issues across the board, but defence and security were our priorities lately. We agreed sometime in the middle of the year that we would sit down and discuss our socioeconomic priorities in December. So, I propose focusing on strategic areas that can determine the near future of Belarus and Russia. Taking issues off the table in the run-up to the New Year, which the people of our countries have always hoped would bring them a better life, has become a tradition. I am convinced that today’s decisions will not disappoint the Belarusians and the Russians and will help improve their well-being and reinforce their confidence as they look to the future. Mr Putin, since our gathering is taking place almost on New Year's Eve, let me, on behalf of the Belarusian people – I think I, and not only I, but all your friends, heads of state that are close to you, will have an opportunity to send you personal greetings – wish you and the Russian people, a happy upcoming New Year.  Thank you. Please. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lukashenko, colleagues, Thank you very much for the invitation. Indeed, our goal is to review some of the results in a wide variety of areas. Recently, we have really paid much attention to the issues of security and international cooperation and in general, we should be content with the development of our relations on this track. Today, we really wanted – and agreed on this with the President of Belarus – to sum up the results of the work done by our governments and different agencies and departments, first of all in the sphere of economy. I would like to note – this is common knowledge, but I would still like to stress it – that Belarus is not only our good neighbour that we have been working with through all the previous decades with due account of each other’s interests, but Belarus is also definitely our ally in the most direct sense of the word.  This is why we have tried to resolve any issues, including economic, based on this information. As for the economy, as President Lukashenko noted, this is our priority, and thus, we need to review the results today. If some issues are still considered outstanding, we must resolve them. In effect, we have come here to look for solutions together and achieve the desired goals. I would like to note that last year, in 2021, we took a big step forward in developing our trade and economic ties. I would like to emphasise that our trade grew by one third last year to US$38.5 billion before any event related to the special military operation. This is a very good and important indicator.  However, in the ten months of this year, our trade increased by another 10 percent over last year, which is also very positive. If we had record trade last year, we have grounds to believe that we will set a new record this year. Our trade will probably reach US$40 billion. We are actively working almost in all areas. In energy, as we noted with the President of Belarus, Russia continues to carry out the nuclear plant project, to its own detriment – we are building a nuclear power plant. The first unit is operational and is now replacing – maybe, the Energy Minister can prompt us as to how much? Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov: About five, over four… Vladimir Putin: Yes, somewhere around 4.5 billion cubic metres of gas. Alexander Lukashenko: Explain that “to Russia’s detriment” you mean that you could have been selling gas, otherwise people will make all kinds of assumptions. Vladimir Putin: We could have sold more gas, but instead, the power plant is operational and generating energy equivalent to 4.5 billion cubic metres of gas, gas that Gazprom could have supplied to the Belarusian market.  We are ready to further develop this project and to build the next units. But what I think is most important is that we are ready to, and we are doing this – creating this industry there, to train people and develop science in this area. We already have tentative agreements on this. We are also ready to discuss them and to act, to move further in this direction. We also have other interesting areas including cooperation and very important areas in the financial sphere, including within the EAEU. There are areas related to military-technical cooperation, and this is not limited to mutual supplies. I believe it is extremely important that this is our joint work, development and cooperation in this area, including development of high-tech production lines. All this is in the focus of our attention. Today, we should review what the departments and the governments have done in general and what we need to do in the short-term.

            "{'date': '2022-12-19T21:20:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, To begin with, I would like to thank the President of Belarus for the invitation to visit Minsk and for the traditionally warm reception accorded to the Russian delegation. As President Lukashenko rightly noted, our talks were very practical – we noted this today during our talks both in the expanded format and just now face to face – they were really very useful and timely. It seems like we meet often enough, and yet it proved very useful to sum up the results of the joint work done by our governments and various ministries and departments during the year. It was useful not only for reviewing what has been done but also for planning our next steps. As I mentioned, we first talked in the expanded format, with the government leaders, key ministers and other representatives supervising specific areas of our bilateral ties, and then continued our talks face-to-face. We also agreed to discuss certain issues over a working dinner. We reviewed the main issues of Russian-Belarusian relations in a business-like and constructive manner, including the economy, the cultural and humanitarian sphere, security and defence.  Of course, we discussed these with due account of the situation that is taking shape in the world as a whole and in our region in particular. I would like to emphasise that our countries are the closest allies and strategic partners, and that we continue to develop cooperation on the principles of mutual respect and with consideration for each other’s interests.  We are united by a common history, moral values, and deep family and kindred ties between many Russians and Belarusians. Russia and Belarus are building the Union State together and are consistently deepening economic integration which is aimed at ensuring sustainable economic growth and improving the living standards of our people.  Together, we are countering the sanctions pressure by unfriendly states and attempts to isolate Russia and Belarus from global markets. We are also coordinating our steps to minimise the impact of the unlawful restrictions on our economies. I can say that we are doing this confidently and efficiently. I would like to state with satisfaction the successful implementation of the 28 sectoral integration programmes that were drafted in the context of implementing the Union State Treaty. As of today, we have carried out some 600 of the almost 1,000 integration projects scheduled for implementation until 2023. It is a very good forward movement, a good tempo. In particular, we have implemented a programme to harmonise our currency control and regulation systems, signed an agreement on a common monetary policy, adopted a uniform accounting and financial reporting system, and launched a common system of product traceability and the Interstate Customs Services Coordination Centre. Our next task is to create an integrated system for administering indirect taxes and a supranational tax committee. Our mutual trade is growing fast. Over the first 10 months of this year, it has increased by 10.1 percent. This is a good result, considering the solid base we have created. As I noted at the expanded part of the talks, our trade grew to US$38.5 billion or by one third last year, and by 10 percent in the first 10 months of this year. We hope that this year our trade will reach a record high exceeding US$40 billion. Russia is the largest investor in the Belarusian economy with over US$4 billion in investment. About 2,500 companies with Russian capital are operating on the Belarusian market.  We are implementing large-scale bilateral projects in industry, high-tech sectors and innovations in many key areas. Overall, Russian and Belarusian enterprises maintain close cooperation ties and have contracts for mutual deliveries of components and finished goods. Russia has allocated an additional 105 billion rubles to our Belarusian partners for financing future-oriented joint import substitution projects in mechanical engineering, machine tool engineering and electronics. I would like to point out that these are mutually beneficial projects, which are necessary not only for Belarus and not only because it needs this funding. Russia also needs these projects to saturate our market, especially after some foreign companies have left it. I would also like to note that Russia supplies Belarus with oil and gas on very good, preferential terms, which is proof of the privileged nature of our partnership and a major measure of support for the Belarusian economy. We discussed the parameters of energy prices. I believe – we have been discussing this with President Lukashenko during our one-on-one conversations – we can assume that we have coordinated all the main parameters, including those that are sensitive in terms of pricing in the energy sector.  In addition, we have been systematically expanding our cooperation under civilian nuclear projects. Next year, we plan to complete the construction of the second unit for the Belarusian nuclear power plant. Its first unit has generated some 10 billion kWh of energy over the past two years. Our countries closely cooperate in many other knowledge-intensive industries such as space exploration, including joint development of satellites. As agreed, a Belarusian cosmonaut’s flight to the orbital station is scheduled for next year. If I understand correctly, Mr Lukashenko has accepted my invitation to visit the Cosmonaut Training Centre in Russia shortly before the CIS informal summit in St Petersburg.  Of course, Russian and Belarusian regions make a substantial contribution to developing cooperation across the areas mentioned. They have established direct links between local government bodies, business circles, public activists, cultural, educational and academic communities.  I would like to take this opportunity to invite our Belarusian friends to the tenth Forum of Russian and Belarusian Regions that will be held in Ufa next summer.  Naturally, during the talks today, we extensively discussed building our common defence space and ensuring the security of the Union State, as well as cooperation within the Collective Security Treaty Organisation in view of the fact that Belarus is taking over the CSTO chairmanship on January 1. I would like to remind you that, as part of the consistent implementation of the Russia-Belarus military doctrine, we work on joint military planning and have an operational Russia-Belarus regional force grouping. Our countries’ divisions and military units currently undergo coordination training in Belarus. We have created a joint air defence system that is already on combat duty. We have agreed to continue taking all necessary measures to ensure the security of our countries, prioritising training of the troops, improving their combat readiness and continuing the practice of regular joint exercise and other operational and combat training events, mutual supplies of essential weapons and producing new military equipment together.  I believe it is also possible to continue implementing President Lukashenko’s proposal on training the Belarusian Army combat aircraft crews that have been re-equipped for potential use of air-launched ammunition with special warheads. I want to stress that this form of cooperation is not our invention. For example, the United States have conducted similar activities with their NATO allies for decades. These coordinated measures are extremely important in view of the tensions at the external borders of the Union State.  Finally, I would like to thank, once again, the President of Belarus for the constructive talks that will surely benefit further development of the Russia-Belarus alliance in all areas.  Our work does not end here. As I said, President Lukashenko also invited me to a working dinner where we will also have things to discuss.  Thank you. President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko     Lukashenko AlexanderPresident of Belarus : Mr President,  Ladies and gentlemen, Today we have held constructive and fruitful talks with the President of the Russian Federation on the main issues of Belarusian-Russian cooperation, just as we have always done. But we were not the only ones, our state delegations included the most ”high-ranking“ officials. We placed the emphasis on strategic areas, above all, in the economy. As usual, much attention was paid to the foreign policy agenda. Russian Federation Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke about the negotiations at the Belarusian Foreign Ministry and the strategic agreements that had been reached. Over the entire 30-year post-Soviet history, the outgoing year was indeed a record-breaking in terms of the number and intensity of contacts at all levels. But this is objective: the situation in the world is changing rapidly, and these changes are, without exaggeration, truly momentous in terms of their depth and scale. In fact, the future of the Belarusian and Russian peoples is being determined. The reality is such, and there is no pathos here at all. Today we can clearly state: together we have not only managed to stand our ground, but also to find opportunities for the development of our economies, although it was to everyone’s surprise and above all unexpected for those who have been creating difficulties for us. The day before, at a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in Bishkek, we had already noted that the West's primitive mass production of economic sanctions against our countries was beginning to fade. Importantly, it is now obvious to all that such restrictions have had a painful boomerang effect on the initiators. And it is not at all the figures that came up with the sanctions who are suffering, but ordinary people and businesses. This is the guilt of those who first unleashed an economic war against our countries and then a proxy war with Russia at the hands of the Ukrainians, as is now clear, ”to the last Ukrainian.“ Nevertheless, the year 2022 gives grounds to assert with cautious optimism that we are coping – and quite well – with the economic challenges. To our own surprise, we are unlocking our enormous potential, which at other times we simply couldn't see or didn't believe in. But we must be faster in taking and implementing decisions, time is now more important than money – that is the essence of our negotiations today. The President of Russia and I discussed the implementation of the common economic development plan that comprises 28 Union programmes. So far, we have accomplished about 60 percent of all objectives, stipulated by these programmes. We have signed a number of basic customs and taxation documents, as the President said. We need to exploit our success.  Programmes aimed at creating consolidated energy markets have key significance. We have instructed the governments to finalise these programmes accordingly.  Regarding the formulation of a joint industrial and agrarian policy, we agreed to strengthen our co-production arrangements. We will not create any unnecessary duplication of production facilities, even if either country has them, and we will focus on the industry. We discussed measures to harmonise transport market regulation. I believe that we will soon resolve all issues in this area.  These issues will facilitate equal opportunities for the operation of economic entities and will make it possible to sell goods under state procurement contracts. We have decided to expedite our work in all these spheres. We need to move faster because time is short.  Obviously, we need to focus our joint efforts on transforming the economies of Belarus and Russia. We need to make them more science-intensive, more high-tech and more innovative. It is also necessary to digitalise them and to enhance our technological sovereignty. Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of our colleagues to something I have already told you about many times at our meetings. You know the subject, but, nevertheless, Belarus is a very small state, compared to Russia. We often talk about the engineering sector, industry, agriculture, science, new technologies and the rest. Some of our colleagues from Russia, especially those from far-away regions, looked at the map and wondered where all this came from. This is not our merit alone. Our merit is that we retained these Soviet-era production facilities. Belarus, to a degree like Ukraine, and western Russia ranked among advanced industrial territories featuring the state-of-the-art technologies and scientific achievements of that period. We retained all this, and we managed to develop these sectors under extremely adverse conditions. We can consume about 60 percent of what we produce, and we export all the rest.  With the withdrawal of our Western partners, it turned out that Russia, with its vast expanses, needs us. This is something we created together quite recently. Therefore, we can also be useful, and if Russia needs us, and it has discovered that the Russian market does need us, we will go there to replace those who have left. Just give us a little more time, and we will replace them by working with the Russians – researchers and engineers – we will create prototypes the world has never seen before. These are not baseless or unrealistic ambitions. We have already achieved a lot. I have already said that our GDP has not fallen by 20 or 25 percent, as some had predicted. Russia’s GDP will in fact decline by two to three percent, and that is it. Vladimir Putin: 2.9 percent. Alexander Lukashenko: Russia will see a 2.9 percent decline, while they predicted a drop over 20 percent. GDP is expected to decline just over 3 percent in Belarus. Therefore, we have not crumbled, and will not crumble in the future. These are all strategic sectors and matters of this kind cannot be resolved today or tomorrow. They need more time. Considering the current situation along our borders, as the President has already said, we discussed certain important aspects of our cooperation in the area of military security. I would like to thank you, Mr President, for the fact that we have been able to find common ground and mutual support on all the topics, and we took the decision we had to take. A special thank you, and not just on my behalf or on the part of the military, for fulfilling your promise. Today, an S-400 complex you transferred to Belarus was put on combat duty. Even more importantly, we received an Iskander complex you promised us six months ago. You have just raised a very sensitive issue, approaching it with great caution. However, you were right to note that we were not the ones who started it. I am talking about training our air force crews in handling special weapons and special warheads. I must tell you that we have prepared our aircraft. It turns out we have had these planes since the Soviet era. We tested them in the Russian Federation and are now working with the Russians to train our crews to pilot planes carrying special warheads. By doing so we are not threatening anyone. I have informed you on several occasions, including during our meetings in St Petersburg, Moscow and in Sochi, that we have major concerns regarding what you call tension along the borders of the Union State, primarily in the West. We felt the need to ensure the security of the Belarusian state. You have made a resolute and very important step to support Belarus. Once again, thank you very much. I would also like to express y appreciation and thank you for the warm, in-depth, engaged and constructive conversation during our meeting with the participation of Belarusian and Russian government members. Thank you for this very fruitful meeting. Thank you for your attention. Ilona Krasutskaya: Good afternoon. Ilona Krasutskaya, Belarus 1 television channel. And I have a question for both heads of state. Your meetings often take place amid the circulation of some kind of conspiracy theories – and you have actually had as many as ten meetings or so this year. What is the reason for such frequent personal meetings? And more, with all this talk about Belarus being “absorbed” by the Kremlin, why do you think these theories are so persistent? Vladimir Putin: Russia is not interested in absorbing anyone; this just makes no sense. Today we talked about – you know, this seems like a trivial and down-to-earth issue but at the same time it is very sensitive for the economy – about pricing and price regulation in the energy sector. Today's meeting was very constructive and very substantive, and President Lukashenko was absolutely right about this. But some “absorptions” were mentioned there as well. But this is not what matters at all. What matters is that pricing should be fair, as the President of Belarus has said. You don't have to be a big expert to understand what the problem is. The problem is that we have different levels of subsidies and different approaches to subsidising specific market participants, the public utilities sector and households. The level is different, the approaches are different, and therefore it is important for us to go deeper in there and agree on some general principles. The same holds true for our efforts to align customs regulation and tax regulation. Unscrupulous critics from the outside either do not know what they are talking about, or they are doing this on purpose, misleading people who are not deeply familiar with the matter. Absorption is not the issue; the issue is coordinating economic policies, as members of many other integration associations do. Anything else is just superficial nonsense or attempts, by our ill-wishers, to slow down our integration process. And they are doing this with the sole purpose of not letting effective and dangerous competitors enter global markets. That's all. Alexander Lukashenko: Mr Putin, you are absolutely right. I would only like to inform you that our “fugitives” are mostly voicing these statements from abroad. About 2,000 of them fled abroad, and they have to earn money because no one provides them with free cash. So, they don’t even write these statements, they simply repeat other peoples’ narratives.  What should they discuss ahead of your visit to Belarus? They can talk about absorption. (Addressing Ilona Krasutskaya.) You should realise this, and you are asking the right question. Yes, they are now starting to chatter about this from abroad. However, it is the end result that counts. What results can we talk about? The President of Russia and I asked members of his delegation who arrived here about some pressing issues. Regarding the energy sector, do we produce gas? No, we get natural gas form fraternal Russia. Do we produce 25 million tonnes of crude oil that we can refine? Can Belarus, which has two upgraded and state-of-the-art refineries, provide them with enough crude oil? No, it cannot. Whom did we ask for help? We asked the Russian Federation. We did not merely ask. All right, these amounts are not a problem. Profitable prices are also important. Moreover, petroleum sales have become a problem nowadays. One can discuss other similar issues. We have discussed all this, and we have adopted a decision on these issues. We talked about transportation and freight traffic, including two-way and coastal traffic, etc. The President of Russia has instructed the Government to finalise these aspects and to adopt decisions beneficial for us as soon as possible. This involves 25,000 freight carriers. We should multiply this by a minimum figure – about 100,000 people together with their families. So, what absorption are they talking about?  The industrial policy, rather than oil and gas, proved to be the most serious and high-priority issue today. We should not create any unnecessary duplication of production facilities. We need to work on co-production arrangements, so that no one will ever push us around, just like they did in the past when investors arrived and later abandoned various projects. Isn’t it profitable for us? Russia can do without Belarus, but not the other way round. We have agreed here that we will act as equals.  The President of Russia and I have just made a very serious statement on defence and security. Let us be honest: can we defend our independence and sovereignty all alone without Russia? No, we cannot. Russia did not abandon us in time of need.  Today, they will claim that Putin has arrived in order to scare someone here. Following our statements, we can see that he has met us halfway, like a near and dear person who holds Belarus close to heart.  We discussed the nuclear power plant. Sergei Lavrov took the floor to say that we will work together on the foreign policy track. Working together means acting as equals, which has always been the case for us. For this reason, any talk of one party absorbing the other begs the question: what for? Russia has always been ready to meet us halfway. There is not a single unresolved issue between us. We have also been there for Russia in an hour of need. You know, the two of us are co-aggressors, the meanest, most toxic people on this planet. The only issue we have between us is to determine who is bigger. President Putin tells me that I am, but I am beginning to think that he is. So we decided to stick together, as equals, and that’s it. But if it occurs to anyone that they can drive us apart, drive a wedge between us, they won’t succeed. In 2020, it was not he [President of Russia] who attacked me. You saw how I came under attack from all sides. But it was not Russia. Russia offered us a helping hand, while blows kept coming from the other side. What did they want? They wanted to take our independence and sovereignty all at once. For this reason, all I can say is that they will never succeed in driving us apart. This will only bring us closer together. In fact, our meeting today with the President and our colleagues can be described as laying the foundation for a leap forward. Make no mistake, we will achieve this breakthrough. Vladimir Putin: There is a reason for having these frequent meetings. Look, as I have already said, last year trade grew 30 percent, which is an unprecedented increase. Now that some of our Western partners are leaving our market, this creates a window of opportunity for Belarus and its manufacturers. Belarusian goods are very popular on the Russian market, including agricultural products, furniture, industrial goods, farm machinery building and transport engineering. BelAZ trucks are very popular. With these trade volumes, we must deal with many administrative issues at the high and top levels. This has become an ongoing effort for our governments, considering the gigantic volume. Much has been done, but we have yet to cross the t’s and dot the i’s. This requires our constant efforts. The President of Belarus mentioned oil and gas. Indeed, Belarus does not have oil or gas, but it does have refineries. There was a time when we needed more petrochemicals for our market, including petrol. We received it from your plants. This means that it works both ways and has been quite effective. Alexander Lukashenko: You have mentioned frequent meetings. First, the situation required that we have frequent meetings as presidents to discuss various matters. Take security, for example. It is obvious that this topic remains on the agenda. There are also economic matters, with the entire world, well maybe not all the world, but its so-called golden billion, or the collective West, coming after us by delivering a powerful, high-tech blow. This compelled us to coordinate our actions in order to act the way we did. We have now summed up the results of the year, as the President has said. We did it. Overall, someone may be jealous that the President of Russia and I have so many meetings. Maybe someone would like to see him even more often. He is open to holding these meetings, but you need to have a reason for meeting. These were his words, when he answered Zelensky. For this reason, stay calm. Everything will be fine. We don’t waste time. Still, we manage to find an hour or two to relax. Ilona Krasutskaya: Thank you very much for answering in such a candid manner. Elena Glushakova: Elena Glushakova, RIA Novosti.  President Putin, you said that you managed to reach an agreement on energy. Does it mean that you managed to agree on the gas prices and all issues are settled?  President Lukashenko, recently, you harshly criticised the slow progress in fulfilling the common gas market programme. Are these issues also settled? Is it clear to you how we will move forward?  And I can’t help but ask about last night and the final game of the FIFA World Cup. Did you watch it and which team did you root for? This question is for both presidents.  And President Putin, if France had won, is there a chance Macron would have got a call from you? Alexander Lukashenko: Got what? Elena Glushakova: A call from President Putin. Many people want to speak with the Russian President frequently.  Alexander Lukashenko: No, it is likely he [Emmanuel Macron] would have called President Putin to tell him happily that France had won, asking for congratulations. Just kidding.  Vladimir Putin: I maintain working relationships with many of my colleagues, including the President of France. We do maintain contact by telephone. As you know, since the beginning of the special military operation, he has visited Moscow several times.  As for the football match, I watched the second half from the moment when the score was tied at 2‒2. I did watch the extra time. Of course, afterwards I could not but call the President of Argentina to congratulate him. I know that Argentina is a football country, and this game is special for the Argentine people who love their team, including major players. I think they deserved the victory. This is first.  Second, as for the energy prices, I have already said and can only confirm that an agreement has been reached.  Alexander Lukashenko: Yes, we discussed this topic and adopted respective decisions. The governments will shortly formalise all these decisions, and I think then there will be a reason to talk.  We have set a favourable price. Russia is very helpful in this matter. There are new issues concerning gas supplies, but it is not yet time to mention them. I can only say that we are content with the outcome of the talks about a common gas market and gas pricing for the next three years, as the President has just told me one on one. The governments will speak more specifically about this.  As for football, you probably know – or maybe you don’t – that I always root for Brazil, and then for Argentina. Why? Because – unlike Russia and Belarus – football is their philosophy, or even more than that – it’s just sacred. Football is their world. I really appreciate the Brazilians because everyone there plays football. I love sports, and even did it professionally for a while. As a child, and in my teenage years, I played football almost professionally, so I am quite familiar with the sport. So it’s Brazil, then Argentina. Because they deify football. As for this match – I watched it beginning to end, starting from the warm-up. I was interested to see the players getting ready, especially the Argentines; they were the first to appear. I watched the whole match. You know, Argentina, I totally agree with the President, Argentina deserved that victory. They dominated the entire time – both the game and extra time. But let's be honest: the Lord God was with France in this game. Because no one can level the score a few minutes before the end, in one and a half minutes, as the French forward did. This just does not happen. But objectively, the Lord retreated – as a true creator. Seeing all this, He stepped back and gave victory in this dramatic match to you-know-who. So it’s the way it should be. Once again, I agree with President Putin that Argentina, with the help of the Lord, finally pulled out the victory they deserved. You can't imagine anything better. This, as experts say, has never happened before. Even in Moscow, when the Croats played the French in the final, I think, and the French won easily. But here, this did not happen. As for Mr Macron, you saw his body language both on the field and in the stands. But I will not contradict my elder brother; what he said was true. Vladimir Putin: May I add something? I would like to add – it seems to me that our Lord was also on the side of the fans. And we must thank both teams for a remarkable game. They gave us a real celebration of football, to all sports and football lovers in the world. Both teams played brilliantly. Alexander Lukashenko: Absolutely right, it was so dramatic. Vladimir Putin: I must say I am very grateful to them. Indeed, it was so dramatic until the very last second; both teams put up such a fight. And they were so good at it. But the strongest won indeed.\", 'kremlin_id': 70148, 'place': 'Minsk', 'title': 'News conference following Russian-Belarusian talks', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin and President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko held a joint news conference following Russian-Belarusian talks.', 'tags': [], 'transcript_filtered': \"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, To begin with, I would like to thank the President of Belarus for the invitation to visit Minsk and for the traditionally warm reception accorded to the Russian delegation.

I believe – we have been discussing this with President Lukashenko during our one-on-one conversations – we can assume that we have coordinated all the main parameters, including those that are sensitive in terms of pricing in the energy sector.  In addition, we have been systematically expanding our cooperation under civilian nuclear projects. Next year, we plan to complete the construction of the second unit for the Belarusian nuclear power plant. Its first unit has generated some 10 billion kWh of energy over the past two years. Our countries closely cooperate in many other knowledge-intensive industries such as space exploration, including joint development of satellites. As agreed, a Belarusian cosmonaut’s flight to the orbital station is scheduled for next year. If I understand correctly, Mr Lukashenko has accepted my invitation to visit the Cosmonaut Training Centre in Russia shortly before the CIS informal summit in St Petersburg.  Of course, Russian and Belarusian regions make a substantial contribution to developing cooperation across the areas mentioned. They have established direct links between local government bodies, business circles, public activists, cultural, educational and academic communities.  I would like to take this opportunity to invite our Belarusian friends to the tenth Forum of Russian and Belarusian Regions that will be held in Ufa next summer.  Naturally, during the talks today, we extensively discussed building our common defence space and ensuring the security of the Union State, as well as cooperation within the Collective Security Treaty Organisation in view of the fact that Belarus is taking over the CSTO chairmanship on January 1. I would like to remind you that, as part of the consistent implementation of the Russia-Belarus military doctrine, we work on joint military planning and have an operational Russia-Belarus regional force grouping. Our countries’ divisions and military units currently undergo coordination training in Belarus. We have created a joint air defence system that is already on combat duty. We have agreed to continue taking all necessary measures to ensure the security of our countries, prioritising training of the troops, improving their combat readiness and continuing the practice of regular joint exercise and other operational and combat training events, mutual supplies of essential weapons and producing new military equipment together.  I believe it is also possible to continue implementing President Lukashenko’s proposal on training the Belarusian Army combat aircraft crews that have been re-equipped for potential use of air-launched ammunition with special warheads. I want to stress that this form of cooperation is not our invention. For example, the United States have conducted similar activities with their NATO allies for decades. These coordinated measures are extremely important in view of the tensions at the external borders of the Union State.  Finally, I would like to thank, once again, the President of Belarus for the constructive talks that will surely benefit further development of the Russia-Belarus alliance in all areas.  Our work does not end here. As I said, President Lukashenko also invited me to a working dinner where we will also have things to discuss.  Thank you. President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko     Lukashenko AlexanderPresident of Belarus : Mr President,  Ladies and gentlemen, Today we have held constructive and fruitful talks with the President of the Russian Federation on the main issues of Belarusian-Russian cooperation, just as we have always done. But we were not the only ones, our state delegations included the most ”high-ranking“ officials. We placed the emphasis on strategic areas, above all, in the economy. As usual, much attention was paid to the foreign policy agenda. Russian Federation Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke about the negotiations at the Belarusian Foreign Ministry and the strategic agreements that had been reached. Over the entire 30-year post-Soviet history, the outgoing year was indeed a record-breaking in terms of the number and intensity of contacts at all levels. But this is objective: the situation in the world is changing rapidly, and these changes are, without exaggeration, truly momentous in terms of their depth and scale. In fact, the future of the Belarusian and Russian peoples is being determined. The reality is such, and there is no pathos here at all. Today we can clearly state: together we have not only managed to stand our ground, but also to find opportunities for the development of our economies, although it was to everyone’s surprise and above all unexpected for those who have been creating difficulties for us. The day before, at a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in Bishkek, we had already noted that the West's primitive mass production of economic sanctions against our countries was beginning to fade. Importantly, it is now obvious to all that such restrictions have had a painful boomerang effect on the initiators. And it is not at all the figures that came up with the sanctions who are suffering, but ordinary people and businesses. This is the guilt of those who first unleashed an economic war against our countries and then a proxy war with Russia at the hands of the Ukrainians, as is now clear, ”to the last Ukrainian.“ Nevertheless, the year 2022 gives grounds to assert with cautious optimism that we are coping – and quite well – with the economic challenges. To our own surprise, we are unlocking our enormous potential, which at other times we simply couldn't see or didn't believe in. But we must be faster in taking and implementing decisions, time is now more important than money – that is the essence of our negotiations today. The President of Russia and I discussed the implementation of the common economic development plan that comprises 28 Union programmes. So far, we have accomplished about 60 percent of all objectives, stipulated by these programmes. We have signed a number of basic customs and taxation documents, as the President said. We need to exploit our success.  Programmes aimed at creating consolidated energy markets have key significance. We have instructed the governments to finalise these programmes accordingly.  Regarding the formulation of a joint industrial and agrarian policy, we agreed to strengthen our co-production arrangements. We will not create any unnecessary duplication of production facilities, even if either country has them, and we will focus on the industry. We discussed measures to harmonise transport market regulation. I believe that we will soon resolve all issues in this area.  These issues will facilitate equal opportunities for the operation of economic entities and will make it possible to sell goods under state procurement contracts. We have decided to expedite our work in all these spheres. We need to move faster because time is short.  Obviously, we need to focus our joint efforts on transforming the economies of Belarus and Russia. We need to make them more science-intensive, more high-tech and more innovative. It is also necessary to digitalise them and to enhance our technological sovereignty. Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of our colleagues to something I have already told you about many times at our meetings. You know the subject, but, nevertheless, Belarus is a very small state, compared to Russia. We often talk about the engineering sector, industry, agriculture, science, new technologies and the rest. Some of our colleagues from Russia, especially those from far-away regions, looked at the map and wondered where all this came from. This is not our merit alone. Our merit is that we retained these Soviet-era production facilities. Belarus, to a degree like Ukraine, and western Russia ranked among advanced industrial territories featuring the state-of-the-art technologies and scientific achievements of that period. We retained all this, and we managed to develop these sectors under extremely adverse conditions. We can consume about 60 percent of what we produce, and we export all the rest.  With the withdrawal of our Western partners, it turned out that Russia, with its vast expanses, needs us. This is something we created together quite recently. Therefore, we can also be useful, and if Russia needs us, and it has discovered that the Russian market does need us, we will go there to replace those who have left. Just give us a little more time, and we will replace them by working with the Russians – researchers and engineers – we will create prototypes the world has never seen before. These are not baseless or unrealistic ambitions. We have already achieved a lot. I have already said that our GDP has not fallen by 20 or 25 percent, as some had predicted. Russia’s GDP will in fact decline by two to three percent, and that is it. 2.9 percent. Russia is not interested in absorbing anyone; this just makes no sense. Today we talked about – you know, this seems like a trivial and down-to-earth issue but at the same time it is very sensitive for the economy – about pricing and price regulation in the energy sector. Today's meeting was very constructive and very substantive, and President Lukashenko was absolutely right about this. But some “absorptions” were mentioned there as well. But this is not what matters at all. What matters is that pricing should be fair, as the President of Belarus has said. You don't have to be a big expert to understand what the problem is. The problem is that we have different levels of subsidies and different approaches to subsidising specific market participants, the public utilities sector and households. The level is different, the approaches are different, and therefore it is important for us to go deeper in there and agree on some general principles. The same holds true for our efforts to align customs regulation and tax regulation. Unscrupulous critics from the outside either do not know what they are talking about, or they are doing this on purpose, misleading people who are not deeply familiar with the matter. Absorption is not the issue; the issue is coordinating economic policies, as members of many other integration associations do. Anything else is just superficial nonsense or attempts, by our ill-wishers, to slow down our integration process. And they are doing this with the sole purpose of not letting effective and dangerous competitors enter global markets. That's all. There is a reason for having these frequent meetings. Look, as I have already said, last year trade grew 30 percent, which is an unprecedented increase. Now that some of our Western partners are leaving our market, this creates a window of opportunity for Belarus and its manufacturers. Belarusian goods are very popular on the Russian market, including agricultural products, furniture, industrial goods, farm machinery building and transport engineering. BelAZ trucks are very popular. With these trade volumes, we must deal with many administrative issues at the high and top levels. This has become an ongoing effort for our governments, considering the gigantic volume. Much has been done, but we have yet to cross the t’s and dot the i’s. This requires our constant efforts. The President of Belarus mentioned oil and gas. Indeed, Belarus does not have oil or gas, but it does have refineries. There was a time when we needed more petrochemicals for our market, including petrol. We received it from your plants. This means that it works both ways and has been quite effective. I maintain working relationships with many of my colleagues, including the President of France. We do maintain contact by telephone. As you know, since the beginning of the special military operation, he has visited Moscow several times. As for the football match, I watched the second half from the moment when the score was tied at 2‒2. I did watch the extra time. Of course, afterwards I could not but call the President of Argentina to congratulate him. I know that Argentina is a football country, and this game is special for the Argentine people who love their team, including major players. I think they deserved the victory. This is first.  Second, as for the energy prices, I have already said and can only confirm that an agreement has been reached.  May I add something? I would like to add – it seems to me that our Lord was also on the side of the fans. And we must thank both teams for a remarkable game. They gave us a real celebration of football, to all sports and football lovers in the world. Both teams played brilliantly. I must say I am very grateful to them. Indeed, it was so dramatic until the very last second; both teams put up such a fight. And they were so good at it. But the strongest won indeed.\", 'wordlist': ['Mr', 'President', ',', 'lady', 'and', 'gentleman', ',', 'to', 'begin', 'with', ',', 'I', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'thank', 'the', 'President', 'of',

This professional holiday unites people who have chosen hard and demanding service. Those who, sparing no effort and sometimes their life, safeguard our state, society and citizens from external and domestic threats, protect the foundations of the constitutional order and the territorial integrity of our country, and relentlessly combat terrorism, crime and corruption. Throughout the entire history of our Fatherland, security agencies have been a reliable pillar of the state. We are rightfully proud of the deeds of their legendary officers who selflessly served the Motherland and resolutely resisted those who wanted to make our country dependent, weak and divided. On this day, I want to warmly thank the security services veterans. Your professionalism, resilience and dedication will always set an example for those who are now safeguarding the security and national interests of Russia. In the past years, our security services have worked very efficiently. I want to thank the employees of the Federal Security Service, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal Guard Service, and the Chief Directorate for Special Programmes for their competence and courage, for being able to promptly deal with the most complex tasks without relying on immediate circumstances. Today’s rapidly changing global situation and the emergence of new threats and challenges impose high demands on the entire system of Russia’s security agencies. This means that you need to significantly improve your work in key areas, and use your operational, technical and personnel potential to the fullest. I would like to call attention to the security agency units that have begun their work in Russia’s new regions. Yes, you are faced with difficult tasks now: the situation in the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, and the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions is extremely complicated. But the people who live there, Russian citizens are counting on you and your protection. And your duty is to do everything in your power to ensure their safety and respect for their rights and freedoms. On our part, we will continue to supply the new units with modern equipment and weapons, as well as experienced personnel. Fighting terrorism remains one of the key priorities for all security services, first of all, the Federal Security Service. You have vast experience in countering terrorism; therefore, it is necessary to continue the efforts to prevent terrorist attacks in a system-wide and consistent way. Crowded places, strategic facilities, as well as transport and energy infrastructure must be under special control. This task falls on the Federal Security Service under the coordination of the National Anti-Terrorism Committee in close interaction with other security agencies. The counterintelligence agencies, including the military ones, need to show utmost readiness and concentration. It is necessary to put a firm stop to the activities of foreign special services, and to promptly identify traitors, spies and diversionists. The FSB Border Guard Service must step up its work. The state border is the most important, key boundary for ensuring the country’s security, and it must be guarded safely. Attempts to break it must be prevented promptly and efficiently using the existing capacities and tools, including mobile and special task units.  You must stay focused in such an important area as countering extremism. Belligerent nationalism calls for violence and provocations aimed at stirring up ethnic hatred are a direct threat to our society’s internal unity. Special services must respond to such attempts promptly. It is necessary to act more decisively in such important areas as the protection of information resources, combatting economic crimes and corruption. Comrade officers, State security, the stability of society, and the reliable provision of the rights and freedoms of Russian citizens are the most important results of your work. I am sure that you know it well and will continue to perform your tasks efficiently, and honestly and properly serve the Motherland and our people.  I again congratulate all of you on the holiday and, of course, the upcoming New Year 2023. I wish you and your families good health and success in the new year.', 'kremlin_id': 70146, 'place': '', 'title': 'Video address on Security Agency Worker’s Day', 'teaser': '', 'tags': ['Civil service', 'Fight against corruption', 'Fight against crime', 'Fight against terrorism', 'Law enforcement agencies', 'National security'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Comrade officers, veterans, I would like to heartily congratulate you on Security Agency Worker’s Day.

Today, we will be honouring outstanding Russians: heroes, trail blazers, creators, people of courage and action who have made a tremendous contribution to developing the country and proven their worth at this challenging and crucial juncture. Our country has had to deal with challenges and stand up for its sovereignty many times. Today, Russia faces the same challenges. On the frontlines of the special military operation, soldiers, officers, militia members and volunteers have been demonstrating exceptional courage and self-sacrifice. Military personnel who performed their combat missions with exceptional valour will receive the Hero of Russia title, which is the highest decoration of our Motherland. We are proud of each one of you and admire the resilience and courage of those who stood up to defend their homeland in the hour of need and performed their military duty in the combat zone, helping bring life back to normal on our new territories. Love for the Motherland, for one's fellow countrymen and fellow citizens is a powerful driving force that inspires us to achievements and victories. And this sense of devotion to our country and people comes, of course, first and foremost, from the family – from the values and moral compass that we learn from birth from our dearest and closest people. Today’s audience includes beautiful women, for whom motherhood has become a real calling. In their large families they bring up beautiful children and undoubtedly deserve the honorary title Mother Heroine.  It is very important to support and protect family ties. People of our traditional religions, including the Russian Orthodox Church, devote themselves to the revival of our spiritual, culture and ancestral traditions, and to social service. Metropolitan Yuvenaly devoted himself wholeheartedly to this path. Here we have teachers, doctors, factory workers and other people who have devoted themselves to various professions. All of you add to the glory and wealth of Russia. Viktor Rashnikov dedicated more than half a century to the legendary Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works. He did a lot for the development of this native plant and the whole metallurgical industry. The title Hero of Labour rightfully marks his merits. Radiy Ilkayev, an outstanding physicist, enjoys unquestioned authority in the academic community. His research and fruitful organisational and educational work has served to create a reliable nuclear shield and unlock Russia’s rich scientific and technological potential. The crew of the Christophe de Margerie LNG tanker and its captain Sergei Gen are helping with the important national goal of strengthening the position of our country in the Arctic and expanding sea transport corridors. Olga Tambovtseva has worked in the agribusiness sector for decades. She is successfully engaged in one of the most complex and demanded areas – livestock breeding. Friends, All of your achievements are inspiring examples for society, for our citizens, above all, for young people. With your deeds and actions, you are literally writing the country’s history and creating a foundation for future breakthroughs and achievements.  I thank you and warmly congratulate you on receiving these high state decorations and honorary titles. Thank you for your attention. <…> Vladimir Putin: Friends, Today, as it has been already noted, we are really living in difficult and unusual times. We keep saying all the time that we are in unusual times, that we are not on a continuous holiday. At all times, a country and every person, if he or she is developing and moving forward, have to overcome certain difficulties on this road. Otherwise, there is no forward or upward progress. That said, today the difficulties are particularly pronounced. There is no doubt that our military, our warriors in the special military operation zone are faced with the most complicated, demanding and dangerous tasks. I said, and this was recalled today, that I sincerely consider all of them heroes – all those who are carrying out this difficult, demanding and dangerous service. They put themselves in danger every second. I believe the overwhelming majority of our people are thinking about this. I am thinking about it all the time. We certainly wish them success.  Of course, we cannot congratulate everyone today. What is taking place here now is symbolic. Not everyone who received decorations is with us. Many have not yet received decorations but deserve them. Those who left us, leaders such as Alexander Zakharchenko – the first head of the Donetsk Republic, are not here. We will never forget about them. There were civilians who did not spare themselves while helping other people, including soldiers. They were involved in resolving the most important and difficult tasks. There are people from different generations, different fields and different vocations in this hall today. They are mothers who are bringing up many children and who get us on our feet. They are teachers and scientists who are creating a basis for development. They are instructors and people of art who are shaping our mentality throughout our lives. And all of them are Russia! They are the power and reliability of our country. The better all our people are working – those who set the pace for forward movement – the stronger this power becomes. These people are you.

            "{'date': '2022-12-20T21:10:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Pasechnik, it is no secret that the situation in the Lugansk People’s Republic remains very complicated, with the key issue being keeping people safe. Still, I suggest we begin with other issues today, namely, economic ones, with the economy, social sphere and healthcare. I would like you to give me a retrospective on what has been going on in these crucial areas, and we will certainly discuss all other issues afterward. Go ahead, please. Acting Head of the Lugansk People’s Republic Leonid Pasechnik     Pasechnik LeonidActing Head of the Lugansk People’s Republic : Thank you, Mr President. The foundation of our economy is obviously the coal industry. The Republic is home to the only fuel and coal enterprise, Vostokugol Republican Fuel Company. This coal company was basically moving towards growth before the launch of the special military operation. In 2019 we reorganised the coal industry and shut down all coal mines operating at a loss.  Around 32,000 people were made redundant at the closed mines. However, 29,000 virtually on the same day went to work in other mines, which means they actually did not feel the layoffs. We offered early retirement to some of the personnel, some other workers were sent to different jobs, so there remained just 500 people that we were unable to provide jobs to. In 2020–2021 we were steadily increasing coal production and the profitability of the enterprise. However, in 2022, due to the start of the special military operation, 58 percent of miners – the ones that were working in the mines, young guys – went to the front. By way of example, only three people are now working in one of the mines where there should be over 300 miners.  The enterprise has become unprofitable. We are unable to reach the level where it would be profitable. In fact, there is not enough money to pay wages. This is the biggest problem. We asked for help from the special commission and spoke to Mr Khusnullin. Funding has been allocated to us – about 1 billion rubles – to pay the wage arrears. But the thing is that this situation cannot be tolerated. Therefore, I raised the question of how this problem can be settled. As for what has been done, it was suggested to me that we privatise the enterprises, which looks like the simplest solution. Yes, we would no longer need to deal with this problem. We would be asked no questions. We would not request subsidies for paying wages. But I have two questions. The first question has to do with the economy. It turns out that as long as the mines are state-owned they are unprofitable, but if they are privately owned, they quickly become profitable, start earning good money and paying good wages to professionals. The question is, are we doing something wrong? We must answer this question. Vladimir Putin: Who is the current owner? The republic? Leonid Pasechnik: Yes, the republic. It is a state unitary enterprise. This is what we propose. There is also an illegal mining company operating in the republic. Vladimir Putin: An unregistered company? Leonid Pasechnik: Yes, exactly. A company buys part of an officially registered coal producer and uses it to legalise the operation of its illegal facilities. Consequently, they are highly profitable because they do not pay full taxes, they do not work in accordance with the established rules and, of course, at some stage they become a serious rival of our state-owned enterprise. For example, according to my information, a huge volume of coal has been delivered to Rostov from our small coal companies, the so-called coyote hole mines. I do not know how this coal is legalised, but it is, and after that it is sold to Ukraine, Europe and other places. In other words, a private company can export its coal whereas we cannot. My first proposal is that our law enforcement agencies redouble their effort in this area so that the operation of these coyote hole mines is cut short and prohibited. I believe that this will increase the profitability of our enterprises. This is my first point. The second, if we cut short and prohibit these coyote hole mines, their personnel will be released, and we will be able to offer them jobs at our enterprises. In other words, we will increase the number of coal producing personnel and also the profitability of the state-owned company. To encourage people to work there, we must make coal mining a reserved occupation, so that miners will not be called up, at least for now, to the units of the Luhansk People’s Republic or the Armed Forces of Russia. I believe that this will help us improve the situation. There is also a political aspect, which I regard as very important. We have become part of the Russian Federation, and it will look wrong if we shut down enterprises in this situation. In other words, our enterprises worked when we were an independent republic, but they will be shut down or turned over to private owners now. Therefore, we would like to ask you to support us, to provide the necessary subsidies for paying wages and for development, at least for some time, possibly six months or a year, until the end of 2023, so that we can take the measures I have described to save face. Since there is also an economic aspect to this, I believe that we will be able to improve the situation and even make some enterprises profitable. There is one more thing which I failed to mention. It is a request to add us to state coal supply programmes. Maybe some regions need our coal, the coal of Donbass. I understand that we will be competing, in a way, with Kuzbass, but maybe someone will want to buy our coal for logistical or quality reasons, because the quality of our coal is very high. Mr President, this is why we are asking you to support us. Perhaps it would be easier to cede the enterprise to a private owner, but I would rather see Vostokugol retain its public status, so that we can continue working.  There is another aspect I have not mentioned. In any event, the miners who are currently fighting will come back and they will say to me, “Mr Pasechnik, we spilled our blood, but we have nowhere to work.” We will have to provide them with jobs, to decide their destinies because they are our people, and we must take care of them.  Vladimir Putin: Mr Pasechnik, there are almost no state-owned coal enterprises left in Russia. This does not necessarily mean that there can be no state-owned enterprises in the Luhansk People’s Republic.  However, their privatisation does not mean that they will be shut down. You said that the people will come back and there will be no employment for them. To be honest, people who work at enterprises care nothing about who owns their company. They want to get paid on time, and they want decent wages that reflect labour intensity levels, the risks involved, and so on.  I repeat, no federal agency will impose any decisions linked with privatisation or any other property-related decisions on you. You must do what you think is necessary. The republic is the owner, and you should make the decision.  Regarding assistance needed today, of course, we will provide it. First of all, this concerns wage subsidies and funding for implementing other measures needed to keep the enterprises going. We will also do this as soon as possible. We need to have an understanding of the specific volumes required. This is the second point.  Thirdly, we need to analyse the current economic status of these enterprises.  You mentioned small unregistered coal enterprises that you call coyote hole mines. Shutting them down seems to be the easiest option. You can do this if the authorities insist. We will provide the required support. However, this will create the problems you mentioned. People will be unable to find jobs. We need to assess the wage levels they have. You see, it is now possible to analyse everything from scratch, from centre-field, as football players say, and to make well-thought-out decisions that would be coordinated with the people. Here is another question: will you shut these enterprises tomorrow? You also say that people will go to work for your public enterprise; and what if they do not?  This also concerns wage levels: they earn money, and, as you said, the produce are delivered to Rostov and to other Russian regions. We should see why this cannot be done with state-owned enterprises as well. You are absolutely right. All we have to do is meticulously analyse the situation and make decisions on that basis.  Leonid Pasechnik: Yes, we discussed this. There was a meeting attended by Prime Minister of the Luhansk People's Republic Sergei Kozlov. Vladimir Putin: Well, now that you told me about it and informed me, I will definitely talk to my colleagues and ask them to come back, look at it again and then report on what they propose and why. The main criterion, of course, is always the interests of the people, the employees, the interests of those who work at these enterprises. We have to provide them with jobs and the appropriate level of wages, which must be paid regularly, without any disruptions. This is what is important. By and large, to be honest, the form of ownership does not even matter. It is important that the state simply keep track of the rules that are laid down for all the people who work in this field. Whether one is the owner or a manager, or an ordinary worker – everyone has to comply with certain rules, prescribed by the state, eventually in the interest of those who work at these enterprises. Do you have any documents on this subject with you? Leonid Pasechnik: I have the documents with me, Mr President. They state in general terms what we ask you to consider and do. But maybe we could take another look, ask the Government to review this. Vladimir Putin: Yes, let us do that now. Leonid Pasechnik: I think this will probably be the right decision. We may be wrong. Vladimir Putin: No, look, I would like to say it again: no one will impose these decisions on you. If you need a subsidy for some time to support these companies, we will do it. This is not the money Russia will stand for. No, this is not an issue at all. The question is economic efficiency. Of course, we must analyse this matter. You are right when you said we must analyse what prevents state-owned enterprises from being efficient. Let us have a look at it. Maybe one could take these decisions and then retain them in the republic’s ownership. It can be done that way too. We will see. Anything else? Leonid Pasechnik: My second question is about medicine. At present, our healthcare system is working quite steadily and everything is great. Vladimir Putin: I doubt it is that great. You have had such a difficult eight years, and yet everything is great? Leonid Pasechnik: You know, these eight years were fairly challenging. In 2019, when I toured the hospitals, I visited a veterans' hospital. Truth be told, I was unpleasantly surprised. Nothing high-end there in terms of renovation, but the premises were up to standard. The equipment and the medications, though, left much to be desired … Vladimir Putin: Obsolete. Leonid Pasechnik: Frankly, it was from the 1980s. So, when we started receiving high-quality medical equipment in fairly large quantities in the last couple of years, and the quality of medical help improved drastically, everyone, including the minister, appreciated it. Vladimir Putin: The situation was changing. Leonid Pasechnik: Frankly, we had never seen such equipment. One could only dream of having it. So, everything is working fine now, but there are issues. We have arrangements with the Russian regions concerning the evacuation of civilians from the Luhansk People's Republic and providing them with help as planned. We are working on transport arrangements, and the regions are helping us a lot, but we are very concerned that this help may still not be enough for us. Vladimir Putin: No, no. The Ministry of Healthcare was instructed accordingly, and I will have a word with the Minister and Ms Golikova. Planned help to the people of the republic should be provided exactly as scheduled, without failure. Should any issues arise, they must be addressed and resolved. We will definitely work on this. Leonid Pasechnik: I drafted a letter on this matter. Vladimir Putin: Fine, let me have it. Leonid Pasechnik: There is a heating problem there. We would like to have some subsidies to bring in firewood and coal at our expense, because we do not have enough of it to stoke a fire in wood-burning stoves. Vladimir Putin: We can do it easily. What is the second issue? Leonid Pasechnik: It concerns communications, the same thing here. We will not be able to do it on time for purely technical reasons. We do not have enough specialists to install wireless communications, the internet, and so on. We just do not have time to build these towers. According to our standards, 10 towers are enough to provide high-quality wireless communications in a given area. Vladimir Putin: I see. Leonid Pasechnik: It works well in central districts, but we are short-staffed and are unable to cover all areas. Vladimir Putin: What needs to be done? Leonid Pasechnik: We need workers and specialists to go there and help us do that. Vladimir Putin: Fine. Leonid Pasechnik: We will send them to safe areas, so that they start working from there… Vladimir Putin: To create a communication system, so to say. Leonid Pasechnik: Yes, to create a communication system. Absolutely correct. Vladimir Putin: Good.  <…>\", 'kremlin_id': 70154, 'place': 'The Kremlin, Moscow', 'title': 'Meeting with Acting Head of Lugansk People’s Republic Leonid Pasechnik', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Acting Head of the Lugansk People’s Republic Leonid Pasechnik.', 'tags': ['Economy and finance', 'Healthcare', 'Industry', 'Regions', 'Telecommunications'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Mr Pasechnik, it is no secret that the situation in the Lugansk People’s Republic remains very complicated, with the key issue being keeping people safe. Still, I suggest we begin with other issues today, namely, economic ones, with the economy, social sphere and healthcare. I would like you to give me a retrospective on what has been going on in these crucial areas, and we will certainly discuss all other issues afterward. Go ahead, please. Who is the current owner? The republic? An unregistered company? Mr Pasechnik, there are almost no state-owned coal enterprises left in Russia. This does not necessarily mean that there can be no state-owned enterprises in the Luhansk People’s Republic. However, their privatisation does not mean that they will be shut down. You said that the people will come back and there will be no employment for them. To be honest, people who work at enterprises care nothing about who owns their company. They want to get paid on time, and they want decent wages that reflect labour intensity levels, the risks involved, and so on.  I repeat, no federal agency will impose any decisions linked with privatisation or any other property-related decisions on you. You must do what you think is necessary. The republic is the owner, and you should make the decision.  Regarding assistance needed today, of course, we will provide it. First of all, this concerns wage subsidies and funding for implementing other measures needed to keep the enterprises going. We will also do this as soon as possible. We need to have an understanding of the specific volumes required. This is the second point.  Thirdly, we need to analyse the current economic status of these enterprises.  You mentioned small unregistered coal enterprises that you call coyote hole mines. Shutting them down seems to be the easiest option. You can do this if the authorities insist. We will provide the required support. However, this will create the problems you mentioned. People will be unable to find jobs. We need to assess the wage levels they have. You see, it is now possible to analyse everything from scratch, from centre-field, as football players say, and to make well-thought-out decisions that would be coordinated with the people. Here is another question: will you shut these enterprises tomorrow? You also say that people will go to work for your public enterprise; and what if they do not?  This also concerns wage levels: they earn money, and, as you said, the produce are delivered to Rostov and to other Russian regions. We should see why this cannot be done with state-owned enterprises as well. You are absolutely right. All we have to do is meticulously analyse the situation and make decisions on that basis.  Well, now that you told me about it and informed me, I will definitely talk to my colleagues and ask them to come back, look at it again and then report on what they propose and why.

            "{'date': '2022-12-20T22:30:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Pushilin, I have just spoken to your colleague from the Luhansk People’s Republic [Leonid Pasechnik]. We know that the security situation in Donetsk is equally or perhaps even more critical, considering the frequent shelling of residential areas in Donetsk by the Ukrainian army. It is a separate topic that we will certainly discuss.  But, as with Mr Pasechnik, I suggest we start with the issues that concern each resident of the Donetsk People’s Republic – that is, housing, water and heating supply, and healthcare. Let us cover these vital topics first and then, of course, talk about security.  Please, go ahead. Acting Head of the Donetsk People’s Republic Denis Pushilin     Pushilin DenisActing Head of the Donetsk People’s Republic : Mr President, Actually, the situation is developing in different ways. Indeed, the restoration of housing and the issues concerning every person such as water supply are of great importance to us.  We have put in great effort, in cooperation with the competent agencies and ministries of the Russian Federation. Several water pipelines have been built to supply water from reserve reservoirs. However, we have been able to cover the demand only in part. In the major cities of Donetsk, Makeyevka and Horlivka, water is available for two hours once every three days.  Thank you very much for supporting the decision to build a new pipeline connected to the Don River. Considering all the factors, it is extremely important. Again, considering that the network repair programme has been approved and considering the enormous water losses, which are just horrifying in percentage terms, we need both the water pipeline and maintenance.  Heating has been affected as a result. Preparation for the heating season was the most difficult period due to water shortages. Of course, we have taken additional measures, in cooperation with supervising regions.  Moscow is helping Donetsk with drilling wells and delivering water in tank cars on a daily basis because the problem of water loss persists. The system may be filled up and the boiler station may operate but water leaks cause the system to shut down automatically and water does not reach consumers.  Therefore, this matter is not resolved everywhere yet. But, even despite the shelling and loss of power at boiler stations, we still try to make sure that all people have warm homes. We have not been able to provide heating everywhere though because of the boiler station shutdowns.  Mariupol is a special case. The heating situation there is slightly more challenging but also slightly easier. The city is no longer being shelled but the scope of destruction is extensive. We have tried to cover the demand by using modular boilers. Overall, the problem may not be fully resolved but we are dealing with it as best as we can.  There are temporary accommodation facilities where we place people, so they do not have to stay in the destroyed housing without heating. The region has been stabilised – again, mostly due to the patronage of Russian regions. In total, there are 17 such regions, but the greatest assistance has been provided by St Petersburg, the Moscow Region, and the Tula Region, and I would like to thank them sincerely. I will tell you that the new facilities built by now – we have never seen anything like this, these new schools and kindergartens. This really gives great hope for the future that we can see. As soon as the special military operation is over, we will be able to fully stabilise the situation, and we are indeed very optimistic in this regard. As for the next concern that people have, naturally, it is about the checkpoints. I have a request for you, and it actually includes several parts. As regards the personnel, and the increase, we discussed this with Mr Bortnikov who said that there are reserves. The problem is that this requires the Government's instruction to comprehensively work on this and expand it. Here is the problem. Since the Crimean Bridge has been repaired, we have additional flows from the Rostov Region, of course, a lot of repair work is underway, plus our people who want to get all the public services that are not yet fully available to them at home. There is something else: we need to speed up the opening of integrated government service centres. With more local centres, people will not have to go to Rostov to register their cars, or to get other services. This system is well developed in Rostov, but here, the process is ongoing, so there will be a request in this regard. And taking into account these steps, with an increase in checkpoints, we can stabilise the situation here, in fact, from Rostov, taking into account the road repairs… Vladimir Putin: Are you talking about the checkpoints on the border between the Rostov Region and the Donetsk Republic? Denis Pushilin: On the administrative border, yes. We have three checkpoints that we would like… Vladimir Putin: All right, we will do this. Denis Pushilin: With the roads, it will take no more than seven hours to get from the Rostov Region to Crimea via the Donetsk People's Republic. Vladimir Putin: The part of the road there that goes to Crimea has been repaired. Denis Pushilin: Yes, a lot of roads have been repaired, that is, more than 400 kilometres. We have never seen roadwork on this scale – all cutting-edge and up to Russian standards. Indeed, where we see the standards of the Russian Federation applied, whether it is roads, or schools, or kindergartens, it evokes sincere wonder and admiration in us. Over the past eight years – and we had lagged behind even before that – we have fallen behind, but we will catch up. Vladimir Putin: I have no doubt that this will be the case, given the people who work there. Denis Pushilin: The next question I wanted to raise with you and submit for your consideration is that we lack utility workers. There are several reasons for that. Apart from the mobilisation, there is also the fact that the relevant colleges and schools did not receive the attention they needed. Our utilities are understaffed by up to 70 percent, while those who are still working are true heroes. You may have noticed that whenever there is an incoming strike, they arrive at the scene immediately. Here is what I wanted to ask you. I think it would be fair to offer them a mark-up on their salaries in the areas that are now literally on the frontline, including in some of the regions in Donetsk. Vladimir Putin: Have you put these ideas on paper? Denis Pushilin: I have. Vladimir Putin: Good. Denis Pushilin: People will definitely support this. I would also like to thank you for the perinatal centre, which is now under construction in the Kirovsky District of Donetsk. The construction workers are at work. Vladimir Putin: How many beds will it have? Denis Pushilin: 130 beds. This new, state-of-the-art centre will help us a lot, especially considering the destruction we now have. The workers have been doing a fine job. They are heroes who find themselves in harm’s way all the time. Construction carries on regardless, and this new perinatal centre is expected to be completed by the end of next year. Turning back to Mariupol, a lot of housing has been built – brand new neighbourhoods, including the Nevsky neighbourhood built by the Defence Ministry’s military construction company. The Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation also did its job by building four apartment blocks, and it will complete six more by the end of the year. This will be new, modern and comfortable housing. Looking at Mariupol, where there is no firing anymore, we know that we will rebuild the republic. Thank you for your support and for paying attention to all the details. Our people will not forgive me if I fail to express our special gratitude for ensuring that students do not get drafted into the army during mobilisation. There was a lot of concern about that. This was a big sigh of relief for us, because we were forced to mobilise people into the army. There was no other way. Vladimir Putin: I see. Denis Pushilin: Students must be able to study. They are our future, our children. Vladimir Putin: But many of them refused to leave the army and stayed in the Armed Forces as volunteers. Denis Pushilin: When someone wants to serve, that is a different story… Vladimir Putin: Of course. Denis Pushilin: Thank you for this decision. Frankly, I am most grateful to you for the Saur-Mogila, our place of power, our symbol. It was not simply renovated but essentially restored, revived, in view of the current circumstances.  Vladimir Putin: The result is beautiful. Denis Pushilin: Very beautiful. I hope that later – not right now, of course – but later we will have an opportunity and you will see what I mean with your own eyes.  Vladimir Putin: All right. What about healthcare? Denis Pushilin: As concerns healthcare, I can tell you that the situation with Covid-19 is under control. The seasonal flu outbreak is slightly worse but our medical workers are doing what they can. We can see that Kalinin Hospital, the largest hospital in Donetsk, has been almost completely destroyed after two days of shelling by those scoundrels.  However, even in view of all the factors, I believe there are no serious problems in healthcare. At the federal level, there is close cooperation with the Russian Healthcare Ministry. All issues are resolved promptly. The difficulties we had in the past in a number of areas are now essentially resolved, so I do not see any extra issues that cannot be handled in the normal course of business.  Vladimir Putin: I have already spoken with the healthcare minister. If necessary, we can arrange to transfer all the patients who require special treatment, to federal medical facilities.  Denis Pushilin: Thank you very much. We will try to manage everything we can. Our medical workers are excellent professionals. Our local medical university trains highly qualified doctors. Considering the difference in wages that was particularly noticeable before, many doctors have left though, as they were highly sought after in other regions of Russia.  Vladimir Putin: But they still need support with professional development. They must be included in the Healthcare Ministry’s professional development system.  Denis Pushilin: Absolutely. On our part, we do our best but there is also a response from the federal government and the regions also get involved.  Vladimir Putin: The resources of the healthcare system must be improved, along with building new facilities, maintaining existing clinics and upgrading them with modern equipment.  Denis Pushilin: The medical multi-purpose centre in Mariupol, built by a military construction company, by the way, was built in 84 days as on a turn-key basis, fully equipped with everything from the building itself and modern medical equipment to kitchen utensils. It was ready to operate.  Of course, for us a project like this is still far amazing because our healthcare facilities are seriously lagging behind when it comes to resources and technology. Many of these facilities have not been renovated since the Soviet times.  Vladimir Putin: Of course. We know this from Crimea. With regard to shelling, as far as I understand, the Ukrainian forces are targeting residential areas of Donetsk. Denis Pushilin: Yes, what we see is targeted firing of shells into large areas in Donetsk, Makeyevka, and Horlivka. In Donetsk alone, 21 people died and 94 were wounded, and 460 buildings were damaged from December 2 to December18. Vladimir Putin: Are these people civilians? Denis Pushilin: Yes, civilians all of them. This, of course, has prompted a very serious response on our part, and the Russian Armed Forces are doing their best. In this regard, I would like to ask you to increase the supply of the latest air defence systems. This and a strengthening the counter-battery efforts would help us to put an end to the shelling of our large urban areas and to push the enemy back. Whenever they have a chance, they use it. They stop at nothing. Vladimir Putin: Let me bring it to everyone’s attention that not a single foreign media outlet or human rights organisation has uttered a word about these developments. Denis Pushilin: Alas, this is true, and we have to live with that. Double standards prevailed throughout the negotiating process in 2014. Vladimir Putin: That is the way it was, indeed. Denis Pushilin: It is as if we do not exist and the developments are unfolding in a completely different way. Let us face it: Donbass was for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and, without a doubt, Russia, as a guarantor country, was too and did everything possible and then some. We had apprehensions seeing how the talks unfolded, but, unfortunately, Europe, and the West in general, has made it blatantly clear that we cannot trust them, because quite recently the former Federal Chancellor of Germany… I can imagine your emotions, because even for us, who did not really trust them, it was a shock. Vladimir Putin: They said they never planned to act on anything and that they signed the document only to buy some time to obtain weapons and to carry out, in fact, military operations. All right, we will talk about this in more detail right now.  <…>\", 'kremlin_id': 70156, 'place': 'The Kremlin, Moscow', 'title': 'Meeting with Acting Head of Donetsk People’s Republic Denis Pushilin', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin had a working meeting with Acting Head of the Donetsk People’s Republic Denis Pushilin.', 'tags': ['Construction industry', 'Economy and finance', 'Healthcare', 'Housing and utilities', 'Regions'], 'transcript_filtered': 'Mr Pushilin, I have just spoken to your colleague from the Luhansk People’s Republic [Leonid Pasechnik]. We know that the security situation in Donetsk is equally or perhaps even more critical, considering the frequent shelling of residential areas in Donetsk by the Ukrainian army. It is a separate topic that we will certainly discuss. But, as with Mr Pasechnik, I suggest we start with the issues that concern each resident of the Donetsk People’s Republic – that is, housing, water and heating supply, and healthcare. Let us cover these vital topics first and then, of course, talk about security.  Please, go ahead. Are you talking about the checkpoints on the border between the Rostov Region and the Donetsk Republic? All right, we will do this. The part of the road there that goes to Crimea has been repaired. I have no doubt that this will be the case, given the people who work there. Have you put these ideas on paper? Good. How many beds will it have? I see. But many of them refused to leave the army and stayed in the Armed Forces as volunteers. Of course. The result is beautiful. All right. What about healthcare? I have already spoken with the healthcare minister. If necessary, we can arrange to transfer all the patients who require special treatment, to federal medical facilities. But they still need support with professional development. They must be included in the Healthcare Ministry’s professional development system. The resources of the healthcare system must be improved, along with building new facilities, maintaining existing clinics and upgrading them with modern equipment. Of course. We know this from Crimea. With regard to shelling, as far as I understand, the Ukrainian forces are targeting residential areas of Donetsk. Are these people civilians? Let me bring it to everyone’s attention that not a single foreign media outlet or human rights organisation has uttered a word about these developments. That is the way it was, indeed. They said they never planned to act on anything and that they signed the document only to buy some time to obtain weapons and to carry out, in fact, military operations.

Power of Siberia is a gas pipeline crossing Russia’s Irkutsk Region, Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) and the Amur Region. The gas pipeline from Blagoveshchensk to the Chinese border began operation in December 2019; later, an 800-kilometre link between Kovykta and Chayanda was built to connect the Kovykta field with the Power of Siberia pipeline. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, good afternoon. Today we are attending a special and significant event, which will benefit the domestic gas industry and the entire fuel and energy sector, as well as the national economy. Irkutsk has become a new gas production centre on the map of the country. We are launching a unique gas condensate project, Kovykta, which is the largest gas field in Eastern Siberia. Its recoverable reserves amount to 1.8 trillion cubic metres. An 800-kilometre pipeline connecting the Kovykta field with Chayanda in Yakutia has been built to transport the natural gas. This new section has been added to the Power of Siberia gas pipeline, thereby putting into operation the entire length of our most important gas transportation route, which will exceed 3,000 kilometres. In addition, Kovykta will also produce gas condensate, a highly valuable chemical raw material. A pipeline and railway infrastructure have been put in place to transport it. I would like to note that the projected capacity of the Kovykta and Chayanda fields is more than 50 billion cubic metres of gas per year. This provides a strong resource base for the Amur Gas Processing Plant, one of the largest and most up-to-date in the world. Its technological facilities will produce ethane, propane, helium and other commodity items that enjoy demand in the chemical industry, in the utilities sector and other industries. A powerful and strategically important production cluster is being created in eastern Russia. It includes natural gas production, transportation and processing. Once operational, this new cluster will ensure a reliable supply of gas and gas products to Russian enterprises as well as our foreign partners. It will give a strong impetus to the socioeconomic development of eastern parts of Russia and create highly productive jobs. We are joined here today by the teams, the specialists who should be credited for developing the Irkutsk gas production centre. I would like to thank the geologists, engineers, builders, workers and managers for their dedicated work, high professionalism and for the result. Congratulations on a great, without exaggeration, a landmark achievement. Wishing you every success in your further work. It is my pleasure to give the floor to Alexei Miller. Mr Miller, please. Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller     Miller AlexeiGazprom CEO : Mr President,  Colleagues,  We are now at the Gazprom project management centre, which receives information on our company’s strategic projects. Here, on your monitors you can see information on our projects underway in east Siberia. Mr President, as you have mentioned, today is a special day; we are launching a unique engineering and construction complex that comprises mining, transport and processing facilities. The priority facilities in the Kovykta field are ready for launch, as well as the Kovykta-Chayanda section of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline. Today, a new and sustainable location will appear on the map of Russia – the new Kovykta field, the largest in eastern Siberia. Obviously, the launch of the entire Power of Siberia pipeline will open up new opportunities for distributing natural gas to the country’s eastern regions – eastern Siberia and the Far East. The natural gas extracted at the Kovykta field is purified from moisture and mechanical impurities and then sent to the Chayandinskoye field via the Kovykta-Chayanda main gas pipeline, where it is mixed with Chayanda gas and is then sent further to the Amur Region. Kovykta and Chayanda gas contains many valuable components – particularly helium, which is used in high-tech industries. Therefore, we are building the Amur Gas Processing Plant to produce new gas products. All of the plant’s facilities have been launched on schedule.  The facilities at the Kovykta field were built in a two-year period. I would like to particularly point out the construction of the gas treatment plant (CGTP-2). In this regard, we must pass on special words of gratitude to the workers there: this plant was built in unimaginable, extreme climatic and geological conditions and was built with the highest quality. Colleagues, many thanks to you for this.  The new Kovykta field and the entire 3,000-kilometre Power of Siberia pipeline provides us with new opportunities for social and economic development, as well as new opportunities for boosting exports. And obviously, it makes Russia a world leader in helium production. (During the videoconference, video linkups were established with the new facilities that are being opened now. Connections were established with Deputy Board Chair and Gazprom Department Head Oleg Aksyutin, Governor of the Irkutsk Region Igor Kobzev     Kobzev IgorGovernor of Irkutsk Region  and First Deputy General Director of the Gazstroiprom construction complex Mikhail Yeremin, who were visiting integrated gas treatment unit No. 2 at the Kovytka gas field; General Director of Gazprom Dobycha Noyabrsk Anton Dzhalyabov at the Chayandinskoye oil and gas field in Yakutia; General Director of Gazprom Pererabotka Blagoveshchensk Yury Lebedev at the Amur Gas Processing Plant; General Director of Gazprom Dobycha Irkutsk Andrei Tatarinov and General Director of Gazprom Transgaz Tomsk Vladislav Borodin, who was at the control room to operate integrated gas treatment unit No. 2 at the Kovytka gas field.) Vladimir Putin: I would like to thank you, your colleagues, workers, engineers and technicians – all who have worked and continue to work there – for your achievements and for how you managed to complete this difficult task.  I would like to emphasise again that projects like this are extremely important for the country’s economy, for Russia and for strengthening its social and economic well-being in the broadest sense of the word. This is promising work, which is creating stability for the economy in general, not only in this region but the economy in general, and it boosts our export potential, and will undoubtedly offer more opportunities for the economic development of the regions in eastern Siberia and improve the living conditions for millions of people living in these regions.  Again, thank you very much. My best wishes and congratulations to all who have been involved in this work.  Mr Miller, of course, I also want to congratulate you again on achieving this result, and I wish your entire team every success and all the best in your work in 2023.  Thank you very much.

The President was accompanied by Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu     Shoigu SergeiDefence Minister  and Chief of the Armed Forces General Staff Valery Gerasimov     Gerasimov ValeryChief of the General Staff of Russia’s Armed Forces . The exhibition was held in the atrium of the National Defence Control Centre.  * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrades, This annual meeting of the Board of the Defence Ministry is taking place at a very important time in the country’s life. The special military operation continues. Today, we will discuss key army and navy development areas based on the experience gained in combat operations. First, I would like to convey my most sincere words of gratitude to our soldiers and officers who are now on the front lines or at military personnel training centres. All of them are fulfilling their military duty with dignity, risking their lives, sparing no effort and providing cover for their fellow soldiers when necessary. And, of course, today we must commemorate our comrades-in-arms who gave up their lives for the Motherland. (Moment of silence.) Colleagues, It is well known that the military potential and capabilities of almost all major NATO countries are being widely used against Russia. Still, our soldiers, sergeants and officers are fighting for Russia with courage and fortitude and are fulfilling their tasks with confidence, step-by-step. Without a doubt, these tasks will be fulfilled in all territories of the Russian Federation, including the new territories, and a safe life for all our citizens will be ensured. Our Armed Forces’ combat capability is increasing day by day, and we will certainly step this process up. I would like to once again thank everyone who is fulfilling their combat duty today, including tank crews, paratroopers, artillerymen, motor riflemen, sappers, signalmen, pilots, special operations forces and air defence troops, sailors, military topographers, logistics support specialists, National Guard personnel and other formations for the way you are fighting. You are fighting – you know, I am not afraid to use these comparisons, and these are not some turgid words – like the heroes of the War of 1812, the First World War or the Great Patriotic War. Special words of gratitude go to the military doctors who are bravely, often at risk to their own lives, saving our soldiers, and military and civilian construction workers who are building fortifications and vital infrastructure in the areas covered by the operation and for their help in rebuilding civilian sites in the liberated territories. Meanwhile, the hostilities have highlighted issues that need our special attention, including issues we have discussed more than once. I am talking about communications, automated command and control systems for troops and weapons, counter-battery tactics, target detection, and so on. This is the combat experience that we must and we will use in the further development and build-up of the Armed Forces. Today, our goal is to implement the entire scope of necessary measures to achieve a qualitative renewal and improvement of the Armed Forces. I would like to draw your special attention to the following. We are well aware of all the NATO forces and resources that they have been using against us over the course of the special military operation. You have all the information, and it should be carefully analysed and used to build up our Armed Forces, as I have said, to improve the combat capabilities of our troops, as well as our national special services. Our units have gained extensive combat experience during this special operation. The job of the Defence Ministry and the General Staff, as I mentioned, is to carefully analyse this experience, systematise it as quickly as possible and include it in the programmes and plans for personnel training, training troops in general and supplying the troops with the necessary equipment. In addition, the experience of the special military operation, as well as what our troops gained in Syria, should, as I have said, pave the way for a major improvement in combat training, and should be applied in our preparations and in our exercises and training at all levels. In turn, officers and sergeants who have shown exemplary achievements during the special military operation should be promoted to higher command positions as a matter of priority, and be the prime personnel reserve to be admitted to military universities and academies, including the General Staff Academy. Second. I would like to draw the attention of the Government, the Defence Ministry and other agencies to the need to cooperate closely at the Coordination Council, which is a specially created platform. You should also cooperate with the heads of regions and representatives of the defence industry. I also expect our designers and engineers to continue the practice of visiting the frontline. I would like to express my gratitude to them for making regular trips and making the necessary adjustments to the equipment. I hope that they will continue the practice of checking the tactical and technical characteristics of weapons and equipment in real combat situations and, as I have already said, of improving them. In general, it is necessary to conduct substantive work with related ministries and departments. We are seeing what works really well and what needs additional efforts. Engineers, technicians and scientists are seeing this. And this entire machine is working. When I said we are improving and will continue to improve our armaments and equipment, I had in mind this process as well. The Military-Industrial Commission must become a headquarters for the interaction of the defence industry, science and the Armed Forces with a view to resolving both urgent and future tasks, primarily related to military-technical supplies for the troops. I am referring to equipment, ammunition and so on. The third point. We will continue maintaining and improving the combat readiness of the nuclear triad. It is the main guarantee that our sovereignty and territorial integrity, strategic parity and the general balance of forces in the world are preserved. This year, the level of modern armaments in the strategic nuclear forces has already exceeded 91 percent. We continue rearming the regiments of our strategic missile forces with modern missile systems with Avangard hypersonic warheads. In the near future, Sarmat ICBMs will be put on combat duty for the first time. We know there will be a certain delay in time but this does not change our plans – everything will be done. Our troops continue receiving Yars missiles. We will continue developing hypersonic missile systems with unique characteristics, unmatched in the world. In early January of next year, the Admiral of the Soviet Fleet Gorshkov frigate will start combat duty. I will repeat, it will carry cutting-edge Zircon sea-based hypersonic missiles without equal in the world. We will continue equipping our strategic forces with the latest weapon systems. Let me repeat that we will carry out all of our plans. Next. It is important to enhance the combat capabilities of the Aerospace Forces, including the numbers of fighters and bombers operating in the zone covered by modern air defence systems. A pressing task is upgrading drones, including strategic and reconnaissance ones, as well as methods of using them. The experience of the special military operation has shown that the use of drones has become practically ubiquitous. They should be a must-have for combat units, platoons, companies and battalions. Targets must be identified as quickly as possible and information needed to strike must be transferred in real time.  Unmanned vehicles should be interconnected, integrated into a single intelligence network, and should have secure communication channels with headquarters and commanders. In the near future, every fighter should be able to receive information transmitted from drones. We must work towards this; we must strive for this. Technically, this can be implemented in the very near future, almost now. I ask you to focus on this when finalising the entire range of equipment and tactical gear for personnel. We know that there are no small things on the battlefield, so you need to pay special attention – I know that the Ministry of Defense is working on this, but I want to emphasise it once again: medical kits, food, dry rations, uniforms, footwear, protective helmets, body armour – everything should be at the most up-to-date and highest level. The troops need to have enough night vision devices, high-quality sights, and new generation sniper rifles. I will not list everything now, but I will mention what is most important: everything that a fighter uses should be cutting-edge, convenient and reliable, and the supply should correspond to their actual needs. If some ministry standards are outdated, they need to be changed – and quickly. I would like to draw the attention of the Defence Minister, the Chief of the General Staff and all the commanders here: we have no funding restrictions. The country, the Government will provide whatever the Army asks for, anything. I hope that the answer will be properly formulated and the appropriate results will be achieved. Returning to the topic of drones, I must note that we have good experience in developing unique unmanned underwater systems. I know that the industry has every capability it needs to create a wide range of unmanned aerial and ground vehicles with the best and highest tactical and technical characteristics, including elements of artificial intelligence. In addition, we generally need to consider ways to expand the arsenals of the latest strike weapons. Fifth, it is necessary to improve the management and communication system in order to ensure the stability and efficiency of command and control of the troops in any conditions. To do this, we need to use artificial intelligence more widely at all levels of decision-making. As experience shows, including that of recent months, the weapons systems that operate quickly and almost automatically are the most effective ones. Furthermore, the partial mobilisation has revealed certain problems – this is common knowledge – that must be promptly resolved. I know that the necessary measures are being taken but we should still pay attention to this issue and build this system in a modern way. First, it is necessary to upgrade the system of military commissariat offices. I am referring to the digitisation of databases and interaction with the local and regional authorities. It is necessary to upgrade the organisation of civil and territorial defence and interaction with industry. In particular, we need to improve the system of stockpiling and storing arms, combat equipment and material resources for the deployment of units and formations during mobilisation. As you know, 300,000 people have been drafted into the Armed Forces. Some of them are already in the zone of hostilities. As the Defence Minister and the Chief of the General Staff report, 150,000 people are undergoing training at military grounds and this reserve is adequate for conducting the operation. It is basically a strategic reserve that is not being used in combat operations currently, but people undergo the required training there. Colleagues, I would like to sincerely thank our people who are helping our Armed Forces out of the kindness of their hearts, sending autos, additional equipment, gear and warm clothes to the frontline and letters and presents to the wounded in hospitals. Even if the Defence Ministry provides our troops with all they need in some segment, we should still humbly thank people for it. I would like to ask the Defence Ministry to pay attention to all civil initiatives, which includes considering criticism and offering an adequate and timely response. Obviously, the reaction of people who see problems – and problems are inevitable in such a big and difficult undertaking – their reaction may be emotional as well. There is no doubt that it is necessary to listen to those who are not hushing up existing problems but are trying to contribute to their resolution. I am confident the Defence Ministry’s dialogue with the public will remain ongoing. As we know, our strength has always been in the unity of the army and the people, and that has not changed. Now for the reports. The Defence Minister has the floor.  Thank you for your attention. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, I will begin my report with the special military operation. Today in Ukraine, Russia is fighting against the collective forces of the West. The United States and its allies have been sending weapons to Ukraine, training Kiev’s military personnel, providing them with intelligence, sending advisers and mercenaries, and waging an information and sanctions war on Russia. The Ukrainian leaders are resorting to prohibited warfare, including terrorist attacks, contract killings, and the use of heavy weapons against civilians. The Western countries are trying to ignore this, as well as instances of nuclear blackmail, including provocations against the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and plans to use a so-called dirty nuclear bomb. It is clear that the current situation primarily benefits the United States, which seeks to take advantage of it to maintain global dominance and weaken other countries, including its allies in Europe. Of particular concern is the build-up of NATO's advance presence near the borders of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, as well as the West's interest in prolonging the hostilities in Ukraine as much as possible to further weaken our country. After the confessions made by Ms Merkel, Poroshenko and other politicians about the true purposes of the Minsk agreements, it became obvious to everyone that Russia was not the source of the conflict in Ukraine; the reason was the Western-sponsored coup in Kiev in 2014, which brought anti-Russian forces to power and divided the two fraternal peoples. This provoked an armed confrontation in Donbass. We are taking action to save the population from genocide and terrorism. Russia is always open to constructive and peaceful negotiations. Russian troops continue to destroy military targets, to deliver massive high-precision strikes on the military control system, defence industry enterprises and related facilities, including energy facilities. They are destroying the foreign weapons supply chain and crushing Ukraine’s military potential. At the same time, every measure is being taken to rule out civilian deaths. As a result, the armed forces of Ukraine have suffered significant losses; a significant part of the weapons and equipment they had available at the beginning of the operation has been destroyed. To compensate for these losses, the United States and other NATO countries have significantly increased their military assistance to the Kiev regime. The 27 countries have already spent $97 billion on arms supplies to Ukraine, which is much more than the cost of the weapons they abandoned in Afghanistan. Some of the weapons the US army left behind in Afghanistan have fallen into the hands of terrorists and are spreading all over the world. No one knows where the weapons in Ukraine will end up. It is necessary to mention that NATO staff officers, artillerymen and other specialists are in the zone of hostilities. Over 500 US and NATO space vehicles, including over 70 military and the rest being of dual purpose, are working in the interests of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The United States and its allies are spending considerable funds on exerting information and psychological influence on Russia and our allies. We have realised in full what the allegedly free Western press is all about. Thousands of fakes about events in Ukraine are published daily according to the same templates on Washington’s orders. Hundreds of TV agencies, tens of thousands of print publications and media resources on social media and messengers are working to this end. The silence of the Western media about the war crimes of the Ukrainian military represents the height of cynicism. All the while, the criminal neo-Nazi regime in Kiev is being glorified. The terrorist methods of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are presented as lawful self defence or acts of Russian units. Armed Ukrainian nationalists are in the rear to make sure no one retreats. We receive daily reports of shootings of Ukrainian army personnel for refusing to follow orders.  We had to increase the combat and numerical strength of our troops to stabilise the situation, protect the new territories and conduct further offensive actions. We conducted a partial mobilisation for this purpose. It is a mark of the maturity of Russian society and a serious trial for the country and its Armed Forces. Mobilisation plans had not been put into action since the Great Patriotic War. The basic system of mobilisation preparations was not even fully adapted to the new economic system. This is why with the beginning of the partial mobilisation we faced difficulties in notifying and calling up citizens in the reserve. We had to fix all problems on the go. We changed the organisational and staffing structures of military administrative bodies in units and formations as fast as we could and took urgent measures to improve all types of support. Partial mobilisation measures were fully carried out on time. Some 300,000 reservists were drafted for military service. The concerted efforts of federal and regional government bodies played an important role in this respect. I would like to make special mention of the active engagement of Russian citizens – over 20,000 people volunteered for service without waiting for a draft notice. To support the national economy, over 830,000 people have been exempted from the draft. They are employed in companies of the defence industry and other socially important areas that are vital for the activity of the state. Owing to the decisions by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, mobilised citizens are entitled to the same benefits and guarantees as contract service personnel. Mobilised military personnel will be trained for combat operations from practicing individual skills to unit cohesion.  Military-political bodies have to shoulder an enormous burden. This confirmed the correctness of the 2018 decision to establish them. At the same time, much still has to be done to make the personnel fully ready for combat operations. In general, the partial mobilisation made it possible to enhance the combat potential of troops and intensify the fighting. The troops liberated an area five times bigger than what the Luhansk and Donetsk people’s republics occupied before February 24. In late May, Russian troops fully liberated from the Nazis the large industrial centre of Mariupol. The Kiev regime had turned the city into a powerful fortified area centered around the Azovstal Plant industrial zone. Following successful actions by the Armed Forces of Russia and the Donetsk militia forces, over 4,000 militants were eliminated and 2,500 Azov nationalists and servicemen of the Ukrainian Armed Forces laid down their arms and surrendered. Peaceful life is being restored. The ports in Berdyansk and Mariupol are fully operational. We play to deploy ship bases, emergency-and-rescue services and ship repair units of the Navy there. The Sea of Azov has again become Russia’s internal sea as it was during 300 years of our national history. Land connection with Crimea by road and rail has been restored. Rail service with Donbass will soon be returned to normal. Cargoes have been delivered to Mariupol, Berdyansk and other liberated residential areas for several months now. Control of the North Crimean Canal made it possible to restore water supply to the Crimean Peninsula, which did not exist for eight years due to the water and energy blockade. During the special military operation, members of the Russian military are displaying courage, stamina and dedication. Over 100,000 people have received state awards, including 120 titles of Hero of the Russian Federation. Over 250,000 regular military personnel have received combat experience during the special military operation.  Today, the Russian Armed Forces are taking an active part in establishing peaceful life on the liberated territories. They have cleared mines from more than 27,000 hectares of land. In Mariupol, military builders have built 12 residential blocks and continue building another six, as well as a kindergarten and a school. In Lugansk and Mariupol, the construction of two multi-purpose medical centres with the latest equipment and 260 beds has been completed in record time. Much is being done to restore water supply in the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics. The construction of waterways with a total length of over 200 km has provided water for more than 1.5 million people. A 194-kilometre-long waterway from the Don River, which is now being built, will guarantee water supply for Donetsk. In general, the special military operation has demonstrated the high professional skills of commanders, chiefs of staff at all control levels, and the readiness of the military to fulfil even the most complicated combat assignments. Our weapon and military equipment samples have confirmed their exceptional reliability and efficiency. The special military operation is creating a unique opportunity to analyse modern methods of conducting combined operations, and the forces and means used in them for the purposes of refining plans for improving the Armed Forces. Russian citizens have provided unprecedented support for the national leadership and the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. This is graphically illustrated by the unity of the army and society. This year, the Defence Ministry has been resolving and continues to resolve a number of other important tasks. In the beginning of this year, it conducted an operation jointly with the CSTO countries to stabilize the situation in Kazakhstan and prevent a “colour revolution” in that country. Russian military units remain the main guarantor of preserving peace in Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh. During this year, they conducted humanitarian activities, removed mines and rendered medical aid to the population. We maintain our nuclear triad at the level of guaranteed strategic deterrence. The combat readiness of the strategic nuclear forces stands at an unprecedented 91.3 percent.  The re-equipment of two missile regiments with the Yars mobile ground-based missile systems has been completed in the Strategic Missile Forces. One more regiment equipped with the Avangard missile with a hypersonic glide vehicle has been put on combat duty. Successful launches of the new Sarmat heavy missile complex during state tests made it possible to start its deployment. Strategic aviation nuclear forces have received a Tu-160M strategic missile carrier and a Tu-95M aircraft. This year, 73 air patrols have been conducted, including two jointly with the People’s Liberation Army of China. Nuclear-powered missile submarines are conducting planned military service in designated areas of the world’s oceans. The Navy has adopted the Generalissimus Suvorov Borei-A class nuclear-powered submarine equipped with Bulava ballistic missiles. The efforts to enhance the combat capabilities of the branches and types of troops of the Armed Forces have been continued. The Aerospace Forces further developed the uniform space system and launched the sixth Kupol space vehicle that makes it possible to continuously monitor missile-hazardous areas in the Northern Hemisphere. Training aviation is being steadily developed. Owing to the arrival of new models of training aircraft, the flight hours of cadets have been increased by more than one third. This year saw the first graduating class of female military pilots. More than half of them graduated with distinction.  The Navy has received a cutting-edge submarine, six surface ships, three gunboats, 11 support vessels and boats and two coastal missile complexes. Serial deliveries of the Zircon sea-based hypersonic missile have gotten underway. The preparations of the Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov frigate with hypersonic missiles on board for combat service in an unplanned area of the world’s oceans have entered the final phase. A vital element of the implementation of the state defence order in 2022 was the delivery of weapons and equipment to the armed forces involved in the special military operation. To build up their combat capability, the delivery of staple systems has been expedited from 2024 and 2025 to 2023. A 10-day schedule has been formed to streamline the deliveries. Its implementation is being monitored by a joint task group of the Defence Ministry, the Military Industrial Commission, the Industry and Trade Ministry and defence enterprises. The approved 2022 allocations, which include the supply of additional weapons and equipment, allowed us to increase the delivery of staple weapons to the armed forces by 30 percent and the supply of ammunition for artillery and missile systems and aircraft by between 69 and 109 percent. At the same time, the implementation of the state defence order with regard to staple weapons has reached 91 percent. In 2022, all the planned events of operational and combat training have been carried out, including 14 international exercises held at different levels. At the beginning of the year, we conducted a series of large-scale naval exercises in training to repel sea and ocean military threats to Russia. The final combat training event was the Vostok 2022 command post exercise, which involved over 51,000 miliary personnel from 14 foreign states. A specific element of the exercise was the establishment of an international group of forces for addressing common tasks. The exercise demonstrated the ability of international groups of forces to effectively fulfil regional security tasks. During a special exercise, the strategic nuclear forces successfully trained in delivering a large-scale nuclear strike in response to the use of weapons of mass destruction by the enemy. An Arctic expedition has been held in the eastern sector of the Arctic and on the Chukotka Peninsula, with a series of combat training and research elements and experiments. This confirmed the technical characteristics of all the types of weapons used in Arctic conditions. Despite the attempts by the collective West to isolate Russia, we continue to expand the geography of international military and technical cooperation.  The Defence Ministry develops relations with the armed forces of 109 countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. This year, we have held 350 significant international events.  The International Army Games have become one of the major joint training events with armies of foreign countries. More than 5,300 troops from 34 countries took part in the games. Held across 12 countries, the games were attended by more than 3 million people. Over the eight years since the first games, 80 training grounds have been modernised. Their training and resource capacity is extensively used for combat training of the military personnel.  The Army annual forum has contributed to strengthening international military cooperation. It was attended by delegations from 85 countries and almost 2 million visitors. Thirty-six state contracts with defence industry companies, worth over 525 billion rubles, were signed during the forum. This event is a successful and dynamically developing project that is substantially more productive than similar fairs around the world.  In August, we hosted the 9th Moscow International Security Conference, attended by more than 700 delegates from 70 countries. It is the most representative military and political event in the world.  This year, we held the first International Anti-Fascist Congress. It was attended by state officials and public activists, Great Patriotic War veterans, nine foreign delegations and military attaches from 26 countries. Forum participants unequivocally condemned any manifestation of fascism, neo-Nazism and chauvinism in the modern world. It is expected that the congress will be held every year. The Russian higher military school is one of the best in the world. Students from 55 countries study at the Defence Ministry higher educational institutions, which is more than during the Soviet times. Starting September 1, 2023, the Donetsk Higher Military Command School of the General Forces will be included in the group of Defence Ministry education facilities.  We continue working to improve the system of Defence Ministry pre-university education. By September 1, 2023, a new Suvorov military school will open in Irkutsk. We are working with the authorities to create a Federal Agency for Veterans’ Affairs. It will help us to centralise the military veterans’ social protection system and make it more effective. Mr President, thank you for supporting this initiative. Housing conditions have been improved for 49,000 military families, and 100,000 people receive subsidies for renting apartments. We are paying considerable attention to the development of military medicine. Thanks to prevention care measures taken in the armed forces, the incidence of medical conditions has decreased by more than 30 percent over the past 10 years. The number of military medical facilities that provide high-quality medical assistance has tripled and the range of services they offer has doubled. Over 28,000 patients have received this type of medical assistance. Our combat medics have proved their worth during the special military operation. First aid is provided within 10 minutes. The wounded are delivered to medical units within an hour and to military hospitals within 24 hours. They have decreased the fatality rate during evacuation stages. The fatality rate in hospitals has gone down to less than 0.5 percent, which is the lowest figure in the history of military medicine. As per your instructions, we have launched a programme to modernise the military healthcare system until 2027. A modern military hospital with 150 beds has opened in Kazan. Nine military hospitals are under construction in Ryazan, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Kaspiysk, Sevastopol, Mirny and Vladikavkaz. The construction of a health rehabilitation centre has been completed at a unique spa resort in Kamchatka. The Defence Ministry is waging a systematic battle against COVID-19. We have prevented the disease rate from peaking during the sixth wave.  We have fulfilled all plans regarding the military construction complex by erecting over 3,000 buildings and structures, while paying special attention to infrastructure development for the strategic nuclear forces. This year, we built 650 high-technology units, including for the Avangard, Yars and Sarmat missile systems. We launched coastal energy and social infrastructure facilities for the Northern Fleet in Gadzhiyevo. A 1,154-metre berth has been commissioned at the Caspian Fleet base, and the construction of another berth has been completed. We rebuilt infrastructure at 15 military airfields to enable them to serve all of the latest aircraft as part of the effort to expand the air force deployment system. Efforts to improve permanent military townships proceeded according to plan. We completed 625 buildings in the park and barrack accommodation zones. In keeping with your instructions, the railway troops continue rebuilding the 339-kilometre section of the Baikal-Amur Mainline between Ulak and Fevralsk, and have already completed some 3 million cubic metres of earthwork, which is about half of the planned work scope. The Defence Ministry has implemented major patriotic education and cultural projects. Twenty-eight cities hosted military parades, and the traditional Main Naval Parade has been held too. In execution of your instructions, Saur-Mogila, a memorial that is a major symbol for the entire nation, has been restored in just 90 days. The Eternal Flame is once again ablaze at the top of this mount. We carried on with our system-wide efforts to promote military and patriotic education for young people, focused on the Young Army movement, which has already gained a foothold in all the regions of Russia, bringing together over 1.25 million children and teenagers. We have been working together with the regions of the Russian Federation to expand the Avangard Education and Methodology Centres for Military Patriotic Youth Awareness. In 2022, this included opening 20 regional centres and 25 centres in cities of over 100,000 residents. More than 150,000 high-school students took courses at 88 Avangard centres over the past year. We believe that setting up centres of this kind must serve as a foundation for basic military training and patriotic education for young people around the country. Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Overall, the Armed Forces have fulfilled the objectives they had for 2022, increasing their combat capability by more than 13 percent and ensuring the country’s defence capabilities at the required level. Measures to bolster Russia’s security: Considering NATO’s aspirations to build up its military capabilities close to the Russian border, as well as expand the Alliance by accepting Finland and Sweden as new members, we need to respond by creating a corresponding group of forces in Russia’s northwest. Regarding the staffing of the Armed Forces, the conscription age must be gradually increased from 18 to 21 years, while raising the ceiling conscription age to 30 years. We must enable citizens starting their military service to serve under contract from day one. We must create the Moscow and Leningrad military districts as two joint-force strategic territorial units within the Armed Forces. We must continue improving branches of the Armed Forces in terms of their composition and structure, increase responsibility of the headquarters for training and deploying units and formations. We need to create two new motorised infantry divisions, including within integrated combined armed forces, in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, as well as an army corps in Karelia. We need to transform seven motorised infantry brigades into motorised infantry divisions in the Western, Central and Eastern military districts, and in the Northern Fleet. The Airborne Forces must get two additional air assault divisions. Each combined arms (tank) army must have a composite aviation division within it and an army aviation brigade with 80 to 100 combat helicopters. In addition to this, we need to add three more air division commands, eight bomber aviation regiments, one fighter aviation regiment, and six army aviation brigades. We need to create five district artillery divisions, as well as super-heavy artillery brigades for building artillery reserves along the strategic axis. We must create five naval infantry brigades for the Navy’s coastal troops based on the existing naval infantry brigades. In order to guarantee that the military can ensure Russia’s security, we need to increase the size of the Armed Forces to 1.5 million service personnel, including up to 695,000 people serving under contract. The transition to outsourcing practices in 2008–2012 decimated the army maintenance units, which had a negative effect on the operational status of weapons and machinery. Efforts to revive these structures were taken in 2012. The special military operation demonstrated that we need to further develop maintenance and repair units within our forces. Next year, we will create three repair factories and reinforce maintenance units within the troops. Staff at conscription offices will receive federal state civil service status with an increased number of military posts. We must complete the transition of these conscription offices to digital technology. Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, With your consent, the above approaches will be included in the plans for developing the Armed Forces according to the established procedure. Our 2023 priorities are as follows: To continue the special military operation until its goals are achieved in full. The Russian groups of forces are to ensure peace and stability in Nagorno-Karabakh and Syria. To fully implement a set of operational and combat training measures with an emphasis on the threats stemming from further eastward NATO expansion. To prepare and conduct the Zapad-2023 exercises. To put 22 launchers with intercontinental ballistic missiles Yars, Avangard and Sarmat on combat duty in the Strategic Missile Forces. To put three Tu-160 strategic missile carriers into service of the aviation strategic nuclear forces. To put the Borei-A Project Imperator Alexander III nuclear submarine, four submarines and 12 surface ships into service of the Navy. To increase the supply of Kinzhal and Tsirkon high-precision hypersonic missile systems. To continue to develop other advanced weapons. To increase to 521,000 the number of military personnel serving under contract by the end of the year, taking into account the replacement of mobilised citizens in the groups of forces and the recruitment of new formations. Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, In accordance with your instructions, will continue to develop the Armed Forces and enhance their combat capabilities next year. We will discuss our performance in detail during the closed part of the board meeting. Thank you. That concludes my report. Vladimir Putin: Comrades, In accordance with tradition, I will say a few words in conclusion of our meeting. I will speak in broad terms, but I believe that it is a matter of interest to us. At least, I think that the matter I will speak about is always of interest but especially so in the current situation. I have pointed out many times and have written in my articles that the goal of our strategic adversaries is to weaken and divide our nation. This has been so for centuries, and there is nothing new in this now. They believe that our country is too large and poses a threat, which is why it must be diminished and divided. Wherever you look, this has been their goal over the past centuries. I will not provide any examples now; you can find them in the relevant materials. They have always nurtured this idea and such plans, hoping that they will be able to implement them, one way or another. For our part, we have aways or nearly always pursued a completely different approach and had different goals: we have always wanted to be part of the so-called civilised world. After the Soviet Union’s dissolution, which we ourselves allowed to take place, we thought for some reason that we would become part of that so-called civilised world any day. But it turned out that nobody wanted this to happen, despite our efforts and attempts, and this concerns my efforts as well, because I made these attempts too. We tried to become closer, to become part of that world. But to no avail. On the contrary, they undertook, including with the use of international terrorists in the Caucasus, to finish off Russia and to split the Russian Federation. There is no need to prove this to many of you in this room, because you know what took place in the mid-1990s and the early 2000s. They claimed to condemn al-Qaeda and other criminals, yet they considered using them on the territory of Russia as acceptable and provided all kinds of assistance to them, including material, information, political and any other support, notably military support, to encourage them to continue fighting against Russia. We overcame that complicated period in our history thanks to the people of the Caucasus, thanks to the Chechen people, and thanks to the heroism of our military personnel. We have survived those trials, growing stronger in the process.  It took off from there, as the saying goes. Not to offend anyone, but I will still say that our geopolitical rivals started using every opportunity they had to pursue their agenda. They started brainwashing people across the post-Soviet space, primarily in Ukraine. And they have been quite successful at that and well prepared, since back in the Soviet era they had entire institutions working on these matters. After the 2014 government coup in Ukraine – let me emphasise that we spent decades trying to improve our relations in the new geopolitical environment – we did everything to build not only neighbourly, but brotherly relations: we granted them loans and supplied them with energy resources for next to nothing. This lasted for years. No, nothing worked. I mean nothing. Let me remind you that when the Soviet Union was breaking apart, Ukraine withdrew from the union. In its Declaration of Independence, and I think – I am actually certain that back then the Russian leadership took this into consideration – Ukraine wrote that it is a neutral state. For this reason, we can understand why the Russian leaders at the time did not see these threats. They viewed Ukraine as a neutral state, a brotherly nation sharing a single culture with us, as well as having common spiritual and moral values, and a shared past. They did not see any threats. However, our adversaries persisted in their efforts, and we must recognise that they have been quite effective. We pinned our hopes, it seems, on our efforts to improve these relations, but they proved ineffective and failed to reach the desired objective. Let me emphasise that we have nothing to blame ourselves for. I say this with full responsibility. You know my position on this matter: we have always treated the people of Ukraine as a brotherly nation. I still think this way. What is currently happening is, of course, a tragedy. It is our common tragedy. But it does not result from our policy. On the contrary, it results from the policies carried out by other countries, by third countries, which have always wished to split the Russian world apart. They succeeded, to a certain extent, and pushed us to the brink we are at now. So, after the 2014 coup – I am not going to talk about the reasons behind this coup and will only say that it was unacceptable. As you may remember, in February 2014, three foreign ministers from Poland, France and Germany arrived in Kiev and put their signatures as guarantors of an agreement between the opposition and the incumbent government. The coup took place several days later. Everyone forgot about these guarantees, as if they had never existed. What should have been done instead? All they had to do was say, “Friends, we are the guarantors and major European countries, so please go back to the negotiating table, go to the polls and resolve the power issue using political procedures.” That is all they had to do. Everyone realised perfectly well that, for better or for worse, the then government would have certainly lost the elections, especially since the then president agreed to almost all the opposition’s demands, including early elections. And when I ask our so-called colleagues why they allowed the coup to happen, they have no answer to that. They just shrug their shoulders and say it just happened. Good grief. It just happened? That way they let us know that no pro-Russian forces, and all politicians, journalists, or public figures who were even slightly in favour of developing relations with Russia were simply killed in the street, and no one thought about investigating anything. It became clear that we would not be given any chance, simply no chance whatsoever to restore relations with this portion of our former common country. No way. In fact, they used terror in a shameless and brazen manner. The brainwashing of the citizens of Ukraine and the neo-Nazi and extremely nationalistic ideology that went on for decades did their job, one way or another. What is it all about? Hitler's acolytes were elevated to the rank of national heroes, and no one seemed to care. Indeed, they are nationalists, but there are nationalists in any country, and we have them as well. But we are fighting manifestations of neo-Nazism and fascism; we are not elevating it to the rank of national policy. While in Ukraine they do and everyone pretends not to notice it. Nationalism does not seem to be a bad thing since it is about fighting for national interests, but the fact that this is done on the basis of a Nazi, neo-Nazi ideology is simply ignored. They walk around wearing swastikas in central parts of major cities, including the capital city, and they make it look as if it were nothing unusual. Why? Because it is the same approach they used in the 1990s and the early 2000s with the international terrorists fighting Russia. Pardon me, but they did not give a damn that those were terrorists, recognised international terrorists. They did not care, because they used them to fight Russia. It is the same now: neo-Nazis are used to fight against Russia. No one cares about the fact that they are neo-Nazis. What matters to them is that they are fighting Russia. But we do care. It became clear back then that a clash with these forces, including in Ukraine, was inevitable, the only question was when. Military operations and hostilities always come with tragedy and loss of life. We are aware of this. But since it is inevitable, better do it today than tomorrow. I think that everyone in this audience understands perfectly well what I am talking about, including the state of our Armed Forces and the availability of advanced types of weapons and other equipment that we have but other countries do not. All of the above gives us a certain margin of safety. We know our advantages: the nuclear triad, the Aerospace Forces, the Navy in certain segments, and so on. We know this, we have it all, and all of it is in the right state. We also see what we need to do to improve the Armed Forces, including the Ground Forces, our counter-artillery warfare, communications systems, and so on. Everyone in this room understands what I am talking about, and I am sure you agree with me. There is something I want to emphasise. We in Russia (there are very few such countries in the world, and certainly not our neighbours, who will be left with nothing soon except for foreign handouts such as money, weapons, ammunition, only handouts – things are completely different in Russia), we have everything. I want to emphasise this: we have every single thing, we have the resources to build up this potential, and we will certainly do this without cutting any slack. Moreover, unlike many other countries, as I said, we will rely on our own (I want to emphasise this) our own scientific, technological, production and personnel resources. Moreover, we will attain our goals without detriment to economic growth or social development, while unfailingly fulfilling our social obligations to our citizens. All the plans outlined here, all our long-term goals will be achieved, and all plans will be carried out. We will not repeat the mistakes of the past, when we harmed our economy to boost our defence capabilities, regardless of whether it was warranted or not. We are not going to militarise our country or militarise the economy, primarily because we have no need to do it at the current level of development and with the structure of the economy that we have. Again – we do not intend to, and we will not do things we do not really need, to the detriment of our people and the economy, the social sphere. We will improve the Russian Armed Forces and the entire military component. We will do it calmly, routinely and consistently, without haste. We will attain our objectives to strengthen our defence capability in general as well as meeting the goals of the special military operation. I agree with your proposals regarding further structural changes in the Armed Forces, but I ask you to report back after the discussion at the board meeting, and we will talk about this in detail again. I would like to thank you all for the effort you have put in, and to share my confidence with you – you must also feel it, the general sentiment across Russia. The whole nation has its eyes on the Armed Forces, wishing you success and good luck. And we have no doubt that we will achieve all the results that we have planned, and everything you are formulating and reporting to me. I have no doubt that all the goals that we set will certainly be achieved. Thank you.  All the best.\", 'kremlin_id': 70159, 'place': 'Moscow', 'title': 'Meeting of Defence Ministry Board', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin spoke at an expanded meeting of the Board of the Defence Ministry, which was held at the National Defence Control Centre.', 'tags': ['Armed Forces', 'National security'], 'transcript_filtered': \"Comrades, This annual meeting of the Board of the Defence Ministry is taking place at a very important time in the country’s life. The special military operation continues. Today, we will discuss key army and navy development areas based on the experience gained in combat operations. First, I would like to convey my most sincere words of gratitude to our soldiers and officers who are now on the front lines or at military personnel training centres. All of them are fulfilling their military duty with dignity, risking their lives, sparing no effort and providing cover for their fellow soldiers when necessary. And, of course, today we must commemorate our comrades-in-arms who gave up their lives for the Motherland. (Moment of silence.) Colleagues, It is well known that the military potential and capabilities of almost all major NATO countries are being widely used against Russia. Still, our soldiers, sergeants and officers are fighting for Russia with courage and fortitude and are fulfilling their tasks with confidence, step-by-step. Without a doubt, these tasks will be fulfilled in all territories of the Russian Federation, including the new territories, and a safe life for all our citizens will be ensured. Our Armed Forces’ combat capability is increasing day by day, and we will certainly step this process up. I would like to once again thank everyone who is fulfilling their combat duty today, including tank crews, paratroopers, artillerymen, motor riflemen, sappers, signalmen, pilots, special operations forces and air defence troops, sailors, military topographers, logistics support specialists, National Guard personnel and other formations for the way you are fighting. You are fighting – you know, I am not afraid to use these comparisons, and these are not some turgid words – like the heroes of the War of 1812, the First World War or the Great Patriotic War. Special words of gratitude go to the military doctors who are bravely, often at risk to their own lives, saving our soldiers, and military and civilian construction workers who are building fortifications and vital infrastructure in the areas covered by the operation and for their help in rebuilding civilian sites in the liberated territories. Meanwhile, the hostilities have highlighted issues that need our special attention, including issues we have discussed more than once. I am talking about communications, automated command and control systems for troops and weapons, counter-battery tactics, target detection, and so on. This is the combat experience that we must and we will use in the further development and build-up of the Armed Forces. Today, our goal is to implement the entire scope of necessary measures to achieve a qualitative renewal and improvement of the Armed Forces. I would like to draw your special attention to the following. We are well aware of all the NATO forces and resources that they have been using against us over the course of the special military operation. You have all the information, and it should be carefully analysed and used to build up our Armed Forces, as I have said, to improve the combat capabilities of our troops, as well as our national special services. Our units have gained extensive combat experience during this special operation. The job of the Defence Ministry and the General Staff, as I mentioned, is to carefully analyse this experience, systematise it as quickly as possible and include it in the programmes and plans for personnel training, training troops in general and supplying the troops with the necessary equipment. In addition, the experience of the special military operation, as well as what our troops gained in Syria, should, as I have said, pave the way for a major improvement in combat training, and should be applied in our preparations and in our exercises and training at all levels. In turn, officers and sergeants who have shown exemplary achievements during the special military operation should be promoted to higher command positions as a matter of priority, and be the prime personnel reserve to be admitted to military universities and academies, including the General Staff Academy. Second. I would like to draw the attention of the Government, the Defence Ministry and other agencies to the need to cooperate closely at the Coordination Council, which is a specially created platform. You should also cooperate with the heads of regions and representatives of the defence industry. I also expect our designers and engineers to continue the practice of visiting the frontline. I would like to express my gratitude to them for making regular trips and making the necessary adjustments to the equipment. I hope that they will continue the practice of checking the tactical and technical characteristics of weapons and equipment in real combat situations and, as I have already said, of improving them. In general, it is necessary to conduct substantive work with related ministries and departments. We are seeing what works really well and what needs additional efforts. Engineers, technicians and scientists are seeing this. And this entire machine is working. When I said we are improving and will continue to improve our armaments and equipment, I had in mind this process as well. The Military-Industrial Commission must become a headquarters for the interaction of the defence industry, science and the Armed Forces with a view to resolving both urgent and future tasks, primarily related to military-technical supplies for the troops. I am referring to equipment, ammunition and so on. The third point. We will continue maintaining and improving the combat readiness of the nuclear triad. It is the main guarantee that our sovereignty and territorial integrity, strategic parity and the general balance of forces in the world are preserved. This year, the level of modern armaments in the strategic nuclear forces has already exceeded 91 percent. We continue rearming the regiments of our strategic missile forces with modern missile systems with Avangard hypersonic warheads. In the near future, Sarmat ICBMs will be put on combat duty for the first time. We know there will be a certain delay in time but this does not change our plans – everything will be done. Our troops continue receiving Yars missiles. We will continue developing hypersonic missile systems with unique characteristics, unmatched in the world. In early January of next year, the Admiral of the Soviet Fleet Gorshkov frigate will start combat duty. I will repeat, it will carry cutting-edge Zircon sea-based hypersonic missiles without equal in the world. We will continue equipping our strategic forces with the latest weapon systems. Let me repeat that we will carry out all of our plans. Next. It is important to enhance the combat capabilities of the Aerospace Forces, including the numbers of fighters and bombers operating in the zone covered by modern air defence systems. A pressing task is upgrading drones, including strategic and reconnaissance ones, as well as methods of using them. The experience of the special military operation has shown that the use of drones has become practically ubiquitous. They should be a must-have for combat units, platoons, companies and battalions. Targets must be identified as quickly as possible and information needed to strike must be transferred in real time.  Unmanned vehicles should be interconnected, integrated into a single intelligence network, and should have secure communication channels with headquarters and commanders. In the near future, every fighter should be able to receive information transmitted from drones. We must work towards this; we must strive for this. Technically, this can be implemented in the very near future, almost now. I ask you to focus on this when finalising the entire range of equipment and tactical gear for personnel. We know that there are no small things on the battlefield, so you need to pay special attention – I know that the Ministry of Defense is working on this, but I want to emphasise it once again: medical kits, food, dry rations, uniforms, footwear, protective helmets, body armour – everything should be at the most up-to-date and highest level. The troops need to have enough night vision devices, high-quality sights, and new generation sniper rifles. I will not list everything now, but I will mention what is most important: everything that a fighter uses should be cutting-edge, convenient and reliable, and the supply should correspond to their actual needs. If some ministry standards are outdated, they need to be changed – and quickly. I would like to draw the attention of the Defence Minister, the Chief of the General Staff and all the commanders here: we have no funding restrictions. The country, the Government will provide whatever the Army asks for, anything. I hope that the answer will be properly formulated and the appropriate results will be achieved. Returning to the topic of drones, I must note that we have good experience in developing unique unmanned underwater systems. I know that the industry has every capability it needs to create a wide range of unmanned aerial and ground vehicles with the best and highest tactical and technical characteristics, including elements of artificial intelligence. In addition, we generally need to consider ways to expand the arsenals of the latest strike weapons. Fifth, it is necessary to improve the management and communication system in order to ensure the stability and efficiency of command and control of the troops in any conditions. To do this, we need to use artificial intelligence more widely at all levels of decision-making. As experience shows, including that of recent months, the weapons systems that operate quickly and almost automatically are the most effective ones. Furthermore, the partial mobilisation has revealed certain problems – this is common knowledge – that must be promptly resolved. I know that the necessary measures are being taken but we should still pay attention to this issue and build this system in a modern way. First, it is necessary to upgrade the system of military commissariat offices. I am referring to the digitisation of databases and interaction with the local and regional authorities. It is necessary to upgrade the organisation of civil and territorial defence and interaction with industry. In particular, we need to improve the system of stockpiling and storing arms, combat equipment and material resources for the deployment of units and formations during mobilisation. As you know, 300,000 people have been drafted into the Armed Forces. Some of them are already in the zone of hostilities. As the Defence Minister and the Chief of the General Staff report, 150,000 people are undergoing training at military grounds and this reserve is adequate for conducting the operation. It is basically a strategic reserve that is not being used in combat operations currently, but people undergo the required training there. Colleagues, I would like to sincerely thank our people who are helping our Armed Forces out of the kindness of their hearts, sending autos, additional equipment, gear and warm clothes to the frontline and letters and presents to the wounded in hospitals. Even if the Defence Ministry provides our troops with all they need in some segment, we should still humbly thank people for it. I would like to ask the Defence Ministry to pay attention to all civil initiatives, which includes considering criticism and offering an adequate and timely response. Obviously, the reaction of people who see problems – and problems are inevitable in such a big and difficult undertaking – their reaction may be emotional as well. There is no doubt that it is necessary to listen to those who are not hushing up existing problems but are trying to contribute to their resolution. I am confident the Defence Ministry’s dialogue with the public will remain ongoing. As we know, our strength has always been in the unity of the army and the people, and that has not changed. Now for the reports. The Defence Minister has the floor.  Thank you for your attention. Comrades, In accordance with tradition, I will say a few words in conclusion of our meeting. I will speak in broad terms, but I believe that it is a matter of interest to us. At least, I think that the matter I will speak about is always of interest but especially so in the current situation. I have pointed out many times and have written in my articles that the goal of our strategic adversaries is to weaken and divide our nation. This has been so for centuries, and there is nothing new in this now. They believe that our country is too large and poses a threat, which is why it must be diminished and divided. Wherever you look, this has been their goal over the past centuries. I will not provide any examples now; you can find them in the relevant materials. They have always nurtured this idea and such plans, hoping that they will be able to implement them, one way or another. For our part, we have aways or nearly always pursued a completely different approach and had different goals: we have always wanted to be part of the so-called civilised world. After the Soviet Union’s dissolution, which we ourselves allowed to take place, we thought for some reason that we would become part of that so-called civilised world any day. But it turned out that nobody wanted this to happen, despite our efforts and attempts, and this concerns my efforts as well, because I made these attempts too. We tried to become closer, to become part of that world. But to no avail. On the contrary, they undertook, including with the use of international terrorists in the Caucasus, to finish off Russia and to split the Russian Federation. There is no need to prove this to many of you in this room, because you know what took place in the mid-1990s and the early 2000s. They claimed to condemn al-Qaeda and other criminals, yet they considered using them on the territory of Russia as acceptable and provided all kinds of assistance to them, including material, information, political and any other support, notably military support, to encourage them to continue fighting against Russia. We overcame that complicated period in our history thanks to the people of the Caucasus, thanks to the Chechen people, and thanks to the heroism of our military personnel. We have survived those trials, growing stronger in the process.  It took off from there, as the saying goes. Not to offend anyone, but I will still say that our geopolitical rivals started using every opportunity they had to pursue their agenda. They started brainwashing people across the post-Soviet space, primarily in Ukraine. And they have been quite successful at that and well prepared, since back in the Soviet era they had entire institutions working on these matters. After the 2014 government coup in Ukraine – let me emphasise that we spent decades trying to improve our relations in the new geopolitical environment – we did everything to build not only neighbourly, but brotherly relations: we granted them loans and supplied them with energy resources for next to nothing. This lasted for years. No, nothing worked. I mean nothing. Let me remind you that when the Soviet Union was breaking apart, Ukraine withdrew from the union. In its Declaration of Independence, and I think – I am actually certain that back then the Russian leadership took this into consideration – Ukraine wrote that it is a neutral state. For this reason, we can understand why the Russian leaders at the time did not see these threats. They viewed Ukraine as a neutral state, a brotherly nation sharing a single culture with us, as well as having common spiritual and moral values, and a shared past. They did not see any threats. However, our adversaries persisted in their efforts, and we must recognise that they have been quite effective. We pinned our hopes, it seems, on our efforts to improve these relations, but they proved ineffective and failed to reach the desired objective. Let me emphasise that we have nothing to blame ourselves for. I say this with full responsibility. You know my position on this matter: we have always treated the people of Ukraine as a brotherly nation. I still think this way. What is currently happening is, of course, a tragedy. It is our common tragedy. But it does not result from our policy. On the contrary, it results from the policies carried out by other countries, by third countries, which have always wished to split the Russian world apart. They succeeded, to a certain extent, and pushed us to the brink we are at now. So, after the 2014 coup – I am not going to talk about the reasons behind this coup and will only say that it was unacceptable. As you may remember, in February 2014, three foreign ministers from Poland, France and Germany arrived in Kiev and put their signatures as guarantors of an agreement between the opposition and the incumbent government. The coup took place several days later. Everyone forgot about these guarantees, as if they had never existed. What should have been done instead? All they had to do was say, “Friends, we are the guarantors and major European countries, so please go back to the negotiating table, go to the polls and resolve the power issue using political procedures.” That is all they had to do. Everyone realised perfectly well that, for better or for worse, the then government would have certainly lost the elections, especially since the then president agreed to almost all the opposition’s demands, including early elections. And when I ask our so-called colleagues why they allowed the coup to happen, they have no answer to that. They just shrug their shoulders and say it just happened. Good grief. It just happened? That way they let us know that no pro-Russian forces, and all politicians, journalists, or public figures who were even slightly in favour of developing relations with Russia were simply killed in the street, and no one thought about investigating anything. It became clear that we would not be given any chance, simply no chance whatsoever to restore relations with this portion of our former common country. No way. In fact, they used terror in a shameless and brazen manner. The brainwashing of the citizens of Ukraine and the neo-Nazi and extremely nationalistic ideology that went on for decades did their job, one way or another. What is it all about? Hitler's acolytes were elevated to the rank of national heroes, and no one seemed to care. Indeed, they are nationalists, but there are nationalists in any country, and we have them as well. But we are fighting manifestations of neo-Nazism and fascism; we are not elevating it to the rank of national policy. While in Ukraine they do and everyone pretends not to notice it. Nationalism does not seem to be a bad thing since it is about fighting for national interests, but the fact that this is done on the basis of a Nazi, neo-Nazi ideology is simply ignored. They walk around wearing swastikas in central parts of major cities, including the capital city, and they make it look as if it were nothing unusual. Why? Because it is the same approach they used in the 1990s and the early 2000s with the international terrorists fighting Russia. Pardon me, but they did not give a damn that those were terrorists, recognised international terrorists. They did not care, because they used them to fight Russia. It is the same now: neo-Nazis are used to fight against Russia. No one cares about the fact that they are neo-Nazis. What matters to them is that they are fighting Russia. But we do care. It became clear back then that a clash with these forces, including in Ukraine, was inevitable, the only question was when. Military operations and hostilities always come with tragedy and loss of life. We are aware of this. But since it is inevitable, better do it today than tomorrow. I think that everyone in this audience understands perfectly well what I am talking about, including the state of our Armed Forces and the availability of advanced types of weapons and other equipment that we have but other countries do not. All of the above gives us a certain margin of safety. We know our advantages: the nuclear triad, the Aerospace Forces, the Navy in certain segments, and so on. We know this, we have it all, and all of it is in the right state. We also see what we need to do to improve the Armed Forces, including the Ground Forces, our counter-artillery warfare, communications systems, and so on. Everyone in this room understands what I am talking about, and I am sure you agree with me. There is something I want to emphasise. We in Russia (there are very few such countries in the world, and certainly not our neighbours, who will be left with nothing soon except for foreign handouts such as money, weapons, ammunition, only handouts – things are completely different in Russia), we have everything. I want to emphasise this: we have every single thing, we have the resources to build up this potential, and we will certainly do this without cutting any slack. Moreover, unlike many other countries, as I said, we will rely on our own (I want to emphasise this) our own scientific, technological, production and personnel resources. Moreover, we will attain our goals without detriment to economic growth or social development, while unfailingly fulfilling our social obligations to our citizens. All the plans outlined here, all our long-term goals will be achieved, and all plans will be carried out. We will not repeat the mistakes of the past, when we harmed our economy to boost our defence capabilities, regardless of whether it was warranted or not. We are not going to militarise our country or militarise the economy, primarily because we have no need to do it at the current level of development and with the structure of the economy that we have. Again – we do not intend to, and we will not do things we do not really need, to the detriment of our people and the economy, the social sphere. We will improve the Russian Armed Forces and the entire military component. We will do it calmly, routinely and consistently, without haste. We will attain our objectives to strengthen our defence capability in general as well as meeting the goals of the special military operation. I agree with your proposals regarding further structural changes in the Armed Forces, but I ask you to report back after the discussion at the board meeting, and we will talk about this in detail again. I would like to thank you all for the effort you have put in, and to share my confidence with you – you must also feel it, the general sentiment across Russia. The whole nation has its eyes on the Armed Forces, wishing you success and good luck. And we have no doubt that we will achieve all the results that we have planned, and everything you are formulating and reporting to me. I have no doubt that all the goals that we set will certainly be achieved. Thank you.

How can we help you deliver on the serious, interesting and important objectives you have in your current position? I have to say that you are serving in your position at an instrumental and interesting juncture in the development of the Union State, as well as in terms of achieving the objectives we have set for it in the interests of the people of Russia and Belarus. How can we be of assistance to you? State Secretary of the Union State of Russia and Belarus Dmitry Mezentsev: Mr President, thank you very much for your kind words. For me, what you said is both a mission statement, and an additional call to action. You visited Minsk just a few days ago, demonstrating yet again that Belarus and Russia have been following their own path in developing their relations. You reaffirmed our allied status and format. I would like to brief you on what has been achieved within the Union State format. Mr President, in the presentation I briefly outlined the mechanism of Union State programmes, which is financed from the Union State’s budget. This mechanism remains in place alongside the major breakthrough achieved thanks to the 28 economic integration programmes. They were adopted thanks to you and the President of Belarus and the position you expressed, which was a truly historical, ground-breaking and major decision. We carried out 68 programmes worth a total of 55.2 billion rubles before 2020 in seven sectors: space – with the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus and Roscosmos State Corporation taking pride in their achievements, as well as healthcare, electronics and microelectronics, manufacturing and agricultural production. Of course, the Union State has been consistent in its efforts to ensure the Union State’s security and securing its borders considering the challenges and threats our two brotherly nations are facing today. We have been paying quite a lot of attention to this sector and facilitating contacts between border control services and defence ministries. The Supreme State Council adopted a new military doctrine on November 4, as well as a migration policy concept, which means that all these elements are part of a single cooperation effort. Vladimir Putin: Mr Mezentsev, the share of electronics and microelectronics was 26 percent in 2000–2020, is that right? Dmitry Mezentsev: Yes. Vladimir Putin: But it is only 9 percent in 2021–2027. Dmitry Mezentsev: This is a forecast. Vladimir Putin: But it is not becoming any less important. Dmitry Mezentsev: No, it is becoming more topical, as you have rightly pointed out. Vladimir Putin: It is becoming more topical, but the funding is decreasing. The number of programmes has fallen from 18 to two. Dmitry Mezentsev: Yes, you are right. Let me explain. We were grateful to the Governments and Prime Minister of Russia Mikhail Mishustin for taking a long-expected decision this year. All the restrictions have been removed from the Union State projects, which could previously be implemented only in education and culture. But the crucial part is that under the new algorithm for implementing Union State programmes, which we are talking about now, the drafting of programmes must be reduced from three or four years to one year. We have made our forecast based on the tactical proposals of our ministries and agencies as the state customer ordering these programmes. At the same time, we expect the high-tech sector to remain the overriding priority for the potential customers, namely, the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, the Industry and Trade Ministry of Russia, the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Kurchatov Institute. This is why we made that forecast. The 26 percent reached before 2020 is a fact, a framework and an achievement of the Union State. Vladimir Putin: Belarus has a substantial framework; it has preserved quite a lot since the Soviet era and has been recently increasing it thanks to the efforts of the republican authorities and President Lukashenko, who keeps a close eye on that. But you know this; work is underway at the level of ministries and agencies. Moreover, our Government believes that it is an extremely promising sphere. And the main thing is that this is what we need, what Russia needs. Dmitry Mezentsev: Yes, a framework that we have preserved. Mr President, I assure you and I promise you that we will address this issue even more thoroughly. We know that the Government will support us in this. Mr President, one of our present tasks is to prevent a poorly thought-out preparation of programmes, which sometimes happened in the past when proposals were formulated. We must ensure that a programme is formulated as a balanced document, included on the list of import substitution tasks and made competitive, as well as meeting the challenges of the new technological paradigm. Trust me, we are fully aware of that, and it is very important that you have drawn our attention to this, which we will definitely take into account. Mr President, we have two more institutions, two mechanisms in addition to programmes funded from the Union budget… Vladimir Putin: Excuse me, we have eight healthcare programmes, right? Dmitry Mezentsev: Yes, they have been implemented. Vladimir Putin: A programme of joint activities on Chernobyl disaster relief. The development of new spinal systems for children with severe congenital deformities and spinal injuries. The use of stem cells. Dmitry Mezentsev: We even brought an 11-year-old girl from Donetsk with her mother here. A fragment cut two vertebrae. Specialists in St Petersburg at the Turner Centre for Pediatric Traumatology and Orthopedics did the unthinkable. Today the girl can move around in a wheelchair, and she has almost regained full movement of her upper limbs, her arms. Vladimir Putin: Thank God. Look, here, further in the presentation: the creation of a therapeutic vaccine against tuberculosis. Dmitry Mezentsev: I would like to place special emphasis on this. These are innovations supported by the ministers of Healthcare of Belarus and Russia. We have plans to allocate full funding to complete the work and carry out preclinical and clinical trials from the Union budget in the next three years. And today this is the dream of mankind: a tuberculosis vaccine. We believe that in three years our main partner, the St Petersburg Influenza Research Institute, will achieve a convincing result. Vladimir Putin: Look, we basically have a vaccine. I am not an expert, but I know that our vaccine is much better and more effective than the European one; this is recognised by international experts, and I think it was the WHO that spoke about this. The European one has side effects after application: up to four percent, while we hardly have any, and the effectiveness is very high. What am I getting at? Will they develop what is already there, or… Dmitry Mezentsev: No, Mr President. Firstly, it is unacceptable, let us say, to pay money as part of some kind of scam. No one will allow deceit under the supervision of the healthcare ministries. Vladimir Putin: I have no doubt. Dmitry Mezentsev: Well, let me tell you that the Accounts Chamber of Russia and the State Control Committee of Belarus are not just meticulous, but extremely strict when it comes to spending funds from the state budget of the Union State. We understand this well, and, believe me, government customers – republican and federal ministries and departments – are working in such a manner, so that, as they say, not a penny is wasted. Vladimir Putin: Good. Dmitry Mezentsev: Mr President, we have just published the rules and regulations the Union State has adopted over the years. As you can see, these two volumes cover the regulatory framework of the Union State. We would like to ask you to have these two volumes in your reference library. Vladimir Putin: Good. Thank you very much. Space is a very interesting subject. We have advanced remote sensing systems already but we need further improvements, as long as we have good, promising projects with Belarus. I know for sure that our colleagues have made some progress in this sector. There is also the manned flight programme. When President Lukashenko visits Russia, will he travel to the Cosmonaut Training Centre? Dmitry Mezentsev: He had plans to visit the Star City. I think that this will happen quite soon. This will once again enable us to highlight cooperation between Russia and Belarus in this sector. Mr President, your decision to have Russia allocate substantial funds for building a remote sensing satellite with a 0.35-metre resolution drew a lot of attention, considering that 2 metres is currently the standard. Needless to say, the National Academy of Sciences [of Belarus] will be partnering with Roscosmos State Corporation from early 2023. Later we will determine whether we need a satellite group. Vladimir Putin: Excellent. Dmitry Mezentsev: Mr President, let me raise the issue of Union State security. Of course, this is a very important topic today. Many infrastructure facilities have been completed to offer the defence ministries a single regional force. Much has been done to ensure the sustained operation of the Belarusian railway troops. There are dedicated programmes and special practices for enabling border control services to work together, including the joint board. Make no mistake, these mechanisms are instrumental for their work. There is a substantial return on every ruble you invest and we can say in all confidence – we have heard this phrase many times, but it comes at a great cost for people in uniform – that the Union State borders are secure. Vladimir Putin: This is very important. There is also the line which reads, “Improving security systems for shared information resources.” This is a topical issue today. Dmitry Mezentsev: Just a few days ago, we submitted a draft Supreme State Council decree on the Union State’s cyber security to Mr Mishustin. We will submit it for approval to you and the President of Belarus at the meeting scheduled for early 2023. We have a proposal for the Foreign Ministry to set up a cyber security training and retraining centre. You were right to say and point to the fact that the IT sector did not receive the attention it required in our forecast. Let me assure you that we will take this into consideration. Mr President, there is also the practice of extending the Union State projects and activities. We are especially grateful to you and to the President of the Republic of Belarus for approving significant funds from the Union budget this year to help children in Donbass. Our group has visited Donetsk three times, and travelled to Luhansk in early December. We have seen how children react to modern computers, interactive learning systems and projection equipment. We handed over two Gorky Automobile Plant buses specially assembled for this purpose, and I can tell you that we got them practically at their cost, to an Olympic reserve school in Donetsk and a sports school in Luhansk. We spoke with the education system administrators, and with the heads of the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, and we know that this work should continue. Vladimir Putin: Absolutely. Thank you. Dmitry Mezentsev: The needs of the local education system are so great, considering its current state, as it could not be improved for a long time – that we will also have to ask you to sign a Supreme State Council order next year so that we could continue this work specifically for the children of Donbass. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. This is our 2023 agenda, isn’t it? Information support, science, technology, security, civic and patriotic education, healthcare, education, sports, social and cultural activities… We have an agreement on this, do we not? Dmitry Mezentsev: And an ironclad confirmation, and approved spending in the Union State budget. We have increased the number of measures to 33. Also, Mr President, if you will, just one small thing. The ministries of defence and the ministries of culture have reached out to us, and we certainly supported the initiative to establish a centre for patriotic education at the Kobrin Fortification in the Brest Fortress. It is not going to be an ordinary, conventional museum. It is important for it to be an interactive and immersive centre for children on the Great Patriotic War history. This will give them an opportunity to discuss who they are today, what they are and how they understand their role as citizens. It will be a dialogue between young Belarusians and young Russians, because 20–25 years from now, it will be their turn to take responsibility for their countries’ future and for the system of relations in the Union State as well. Vladimir Putin: We will definitely support this.

            "{'date': '2022-12-22T17:50:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues and friends, Today, at our traditional meeting on the eve of the New Year we will analyse issues related to the implementation of youth policy. As you can see, there are representatives of these movements with us. I had an opportunity to see an exhibit in the Manezh that they prepared. It is very interesting, and I will say a few words about it. However, I would like to begin with what we know well, something that may be obvious. The topic we will discuss today is certainly of strategic importance because young people who represent our rising generations are starting out in life. In 20, or in some cases, even in 10 years’ time, they will be doing what we are doing today, things we are putting our effort in – implementing the national development goals we identify. Their talents and achievements in many diverse areas will directly influence the development of Russia, and their aspirations and ideas, their understanding of the Fatherland and the importance of its millennium-long history, its values and traditions and their devotion to the homeland will, of course, determine its future. Therefore, our key task is to ensure the deep and substantive continuity of generations. In this sense, the courage, energy and a striving for transformation, which the youth have, will work for Russia, and make a contribution to the strengthening of our home country. There are about 40 million young people in our country. Naturally, they are called on to go forward and make breakthroughs that seemed impossible before. We just talked about this, and one person here expressed an absolutely correct idea – that it is typical for young people to not repeat or even improve something but to look for a new road and follow it. This is exactly so. We must do all we can to help them follow this road, to create conditions for the full realisation of their potential. We must help them find themselves and find a vocation that will allow them to realise themselves and to be in demand. Today we will discuss what has already been done and what still lies ahead, what additional measures we should take to support self-realisation among Russia’s young citizens. As I have said, before our meeting I looked over some very interesting projects at the Manezh, and I must say that the young people I talked to have a common outlook, what we call in such cases an active stance in life. They are always ready to help those who really need support, resolve the problems in their cities and villages, be sensitive to nature and promote sports and creative initiatives.  These attitudes prove that we still manage to carry out many plans in our youth policy. I said “still” because we do not manage to carry out everything. But this is why we have gathered here today – to discuss what should be done to implement our plans as fully as possible. I would like to make special mention of the volunteers who support our military and their families, who are helping civilians in the special military operation zone at the call of the heart in the direct sense of this word, sometimes even risking their health and lives.  I must note that participation in volunteer projects has become a normal part of life for many people. Of course, it is necessary to support this noble effort. Thus, we need to create conditions that allow college and university students to combine their studies with practical training at volunteer centres, charity foundations, and socially-oriented NGOs, to gain experience in civil responsibility and solidarity. In the past few years, much has been done to create new social lifts. In this context, I would like to mention a platform that I hope is already well-known in the country, Russia – Land of Opportunity. Its projects and competitions open serious horizons for unlocking the professional potential of young people. This platform is very popular with them; I have learned that some 18 million people are participating. If we assume we have 40 million young people, it appears that 18 million is almost half. This is very impressive, regardless of where these people live – in a big city or a regional centre. I will emphasise that in general, a comprehensive system for the support of youth must be available all over the country. All young people should be able to use it freely, to have an opportunity to receive high quality, comprehensive education, find an interesting job and feel the state’s concern when their children are born and when they purchase their housing. It is very important that today young people of all ages are in the focus of attention. Thus, recently the first congress of the Russian Children's Movement was held, attended by representatives of all Russian regions. They also outlined the movement’s values, such as friendship, patriotism, justice, mutual assistance, and chose a worthy name for their organisation: Movement of the First. Of course, I would like to wish them good luck, and I ask the heads of Russian regions and my colleagues present here to provide the new association with comprehensive support. Considering age rather than area of activity, work on the youth track requires integration and active participation of many authorities. In this regard, the Federal Agency for Youth Affairs is carrying out the so-called administrative linking of these activities. A number of ministries have already designated persons responsible for the youth sector with the status of deputy ministers. This model is being successfully implemented at the level of the largest domestic companies, and they are also involved in this work. In 40 regions there are independent units that coordinate youth policy. I expect that this network will cover all 89 regions by 2024. Of course, as we work with youth, we need to eliminate formalism and bureaucracy. We need to listen carefully to the requests of the youth, considering that the youth of Russia is multinational and represents different faiths, so we need to act subtly and very delicately. This year, the Region for the Young programme was launched to accelerate advancements in youth policy locally. In the next three years, the Russian regions will receive 15 billion rubles on a competitive basis. These funds should serve to fundamentally redefine the very essence of youth policy and maximise the circle of young people involved in creative and socially-oriented activities. Let me emphasise that the content of youth projects is of particular importance today. Due to the well-known events of a geopolitical nature, young people came under a flurry of information attacks and found themselves in a very vulnerable position. This informational confrontation has always been going on, but it is especially harsh now. Our task is to give young Russians a solid foundation in the form of credible knowledge, and to do this, we must develop and introduce a separate course on the history and foundations of Russian statehood in the educational processes. Educational projects are especially important now. Of course, there are tools for this, such as themed classes in schools, in extracurricular education or in military-patriotic and history clubs. The project under the patronage of Russian universities, University Sessions, has also proven to be successful. With its help – I hope that it has also reached those young people who are here with us today in the hall – people from the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, and the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions have come into contact with the traditions and culture of different regions of Russia and made a lot of new friends. And such formats, of course, should be expanded. I would like to note that the flagship education projects, which have been successfully carried out by the revived Znaniye Society for two years now, play a special role today. This organisation has done good work following a new model: new, modern formats of lectures, workshops, and education marathons have become really popular among the youth. I want to congratulate everyone involved in this, because in today’s conditions, in the world of the internet, this is very difficult to do, but, apparently, we hit the bull’s eye, because there is a lot of information on the internet, but not much of it is reliable enough. And so, when information is presented by truly recognised professionals, it enjoys credibility, and this is of great importance. I hope that in the course of this work and its continuation, young men and young ladies will also learn about our legendary fellow countrymen: engineers, designers, and scientists, such as Korolev, Kurchatov, Vavilov and many, many others, whose discoveries and inventions put our country in a leading position in the most important areas of progress for a great many years.  Examples of such active patriotism should become an inspiring force for the younger generation, attract children with knowledge, and inspire them to study subjects like physics, chemistry, biology in depth from an early age, and, that way raise a new impressive generation of scientific leaders who will successfully ensure the technological sovereignty of Russia. And I would like to elaborate on support and promotion opportunities for personnel, those specialists who work with young people locally. When performing such important work, they should feel the attention and support of the federal and regional authorities. Colleagues, I would like you to focus on this. The conditions of their work and the resources they are provided with must correspond to the high importance of the jobs they do.  Before getting down to the discussion, I would like to wish all of the State Council members, staff members, and all regional teams a Happy New Year. Next, we will hear from Dmitry Artyukhov, chairman of the State Council Commission on Youth Policy. <…> Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, we have a draft list of instructions that specifies everything the State Council Commission and the Government have been involved in and also what they believe we need to activate.  Of course, the key issue here is developing and approving a strategy for carrying out the youth policy in the Russian Federation. Next, there are issues of creating an effective environment for the self-fulfillment of young people, as well as wage levels, organising the work of the related specialists and so on.  Hopefully, you have read this draft list of instructions. Do you have any comments? As I understand, if [Finance Minister] Mr Siluanov has not raised his hand, he agrees to everything. (Laughter.)  What would I like to say in conclusion? We used to meet for a half business/half party dinner at the end of the year, but I believe you understand that this year we will not do that. Still, I want to thank all of you for your work throughout this year and extend my season’s greetings to you and your families. I also want to thank our guests. I do not think they took an interest in everything we were talking about in our current work. However, it might be useful because it has at least allowed them to gain insight into our world and have a look at what we are doing and how we do it. Hopefully, they will use this later in their work. The issue we have addressed today is not just a worthy effort, it is also very important. I said this in the beginning of my opening remarks. Apparently, nothing can be added to this.  I would like to thank the State Council working group, and I hope the proposals that have been put forward will be carried out through our joint efforts.  Thank you all very much for our joint work today.\", 'kremlin_id': 70169, 'place': 'The Kremlin, Moscow', 'title': 'State Council meeting', 'teaser': 'The President held a State Council meeting on implementing youth policy in St George’s Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace.', 'tags': ['Social services'], 'transcript_filtered': \"Good afternoon, colleagues and friends, Today, at our traditional meeting on the eve of the New Year we will analyse issues related to the implementation of youth policy. As you can see, there are representatives of these movements with us. I had an opportunity to see an exhibit in the Manezh that they prepared. It is very interesting, and I will say a few words about it. However, I would like to begin with what we know well, something that may be obvious. The topic we will discuss today is certainly of strategic importance because young people who represent our rising generations are starting out in life. In 20, or in some cases, even in 10 years’ time, they will be doing what we are doing today, things we are putting our effort in – implementing the national development goals we identify. Their talents and achievements in many diverse areas will directly influence the development of Russia, and their aspirations and ideas, their understanding of the Fatherland and the importance of its millennium-long history, its values and traditions and their devotion to the homeland will, of course, determine its future. Therefore, our key task is to ensure the deep and substantive continuity of generations. In this sense, the courage, energy and a striving for transformation, which the youth have, will work for Russia, and make a contribution to the strengthening of our home country. There are about 40 million young people in our country. Naturally, they are called on to go forward and make breakthroughs that seemed impossible before. We just talked about this, and one person here expressed an absolutely correct idea – that it is typical for young people to not repeat or even improve something but to look for a new road and follow it. This is exactly so. We must do all we can to help them follow this road, to create conditions for the full realisation of their potential. We must help them find themselves and find a vocation that will allow them to realise themselves and to be in demand. Today we will discuss what has already been done and what still lies ahead, what additional measures we should take to support self-realisation among Russia’s young citizens. As I have said, before our meeting I looked over some very interesting projects at the Manezh, and I must say that the young people I talked to have a common outlook, what we call in such cases an active stance in life. They are always ready to help those who really need support, resolve the problems in their cities and villages, be sensitive to nature and promote sports and creative initiatives.  These attitudes prove that we still manage to carry out many plans in our youth policy. I said “still” because we do not manage to carry out everything. But this is why we have gathered here today – to discuss what should be done to implement our plans as fully as possible. I would like to make special mention of the volunteers who support our military and their families, who are helping civilians in the special military operation zone at the call of the heart in the direct sense of this word, sometimes even risking their health and lives.  I must note that participation in volunteer projects has become a normal part of life for many people. Of course, it is necessary to support this noble effort. Thus, we need to create conditions that allow college and university students to combine their studies with practical training at volunteer centres, charity foundations, and socially-oriented NGOs, to gain experience in civil responsibility and solidarity. In the past few years, much has been done to create new social lifts. In this context, I would like to mention a platform that I hope is already well-known in the country, Russia – Land of Opportunity. Its projects and competitions open serious horizons for unlocking the professional potential of young people. This platform is very popular with them; I have learned that some 18 million people are participating. If we assume we have 40 million young people, it appears that 18 million is almost half. This is very impressive, regardless of where these people live – in a big city or a regional centre. I will emphasise that in general, a comprehensive system for the support of youth must be available all over the country. All young people should be able to use it freely, to have an opportunity to receive high quality, comprehensive education, find an interesting job and feel the state’s concern when their children are born and when they purchase their housing. It is very important that today young people of all ages are in the focus of attention. Thus, recently the first congress of the Russian Children's Movement was held, attended by representatives of all Russian regions. They also outlined the movement’s values, such as friendship, patriotism, justice, mutual assistance, and chose a worthy name for their organisation: Movement of the First. Of course, I would like to wish them good luck, and I ask the heads of Russian regions and my colleagues present here to provide the new association with comprehensive support. Considering age rather than area of activity, work on the youth track requires integration and active participation of many authorities. In this regard, the Federal Agency for Youth Affairs is carrying out the so-called administrative linking of these activities. A number of ministries have already designated persons responsible for the youth sector with the status of deputy ministers. This model is being successfully implemented at the level of the largest domestic companies, and they are also involved in this work. In 40 regions there are independent units that coordinate youth policy. I expect that this network will cover all 89 regions by 2024. Of course, as we work with youth, we need to eliminate formalism and bureaucracy. We need to listen carefully to the requests of the youth, considering that the youth of Russia is multinational and represents different faiths, so we need to act subtly and very delicately. This year, the Region for the Young programme was launched to accelerate advancements in youth policy locally. In the next three years, the Russian regions will receive 15 billion rubles on a competitive basis. These funds should serve to fundamentally redefine the very essence of youth policy and maximise the circle of young people involved in creative and socially-oriented activities. Let me emphasise that the content of youth projects is of particular importance today. Due to the well-known events of a geopolitical nature, young people came under a flurry of information attacks and found themselves in a very vulnerable position. This informational confrontation has always been going on, but it is especially harsh now. Our task is to give young Russians a solid foundation in the form of credible knowledge, and to do this, we must develop and introduce a separate course on the history and foundations of Russian statehood in the educational processes. Educational projects are especially important now. Of course, there are tools for this, such as themed classes in schools, in extracurricular education or in military-patriotic and history clubs. The project under the patronage of Russian universities, University Sessions, has also proven to be successful. With its help – I hope that it has also reached those young people who are here with us today in the hall – people from the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, and the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions have come into contact with the traditions and culture of different regions of Russia and made a lot of new friends. And such formats, of course, should be expanded. I would like to note that the flagship education projects, which have been successfully carried out by the revived Znaniye Society for two years now, play a special role today. This organisation has done good work following a new model: new, modern formats of lectures, workshops, and education marathons have become really popular among the youth. I want to congratulate everyone involved in this, because in today’s conditions, in the world of the internet, this is very difficult to do, but, apparently, we hit the bull’s eye, because there is a lot of information on the internet, but not much of it is reliable enough. And so, when information is presented by truly recognised professionals, it enjoys credibility, and this is of great importance. I hope that in the course of this work and its continuation, young men and young ladies will also learn about our legendary fellow countrymen: engineers, designers, and scientists, such as Korolev, Kurchatov, Vavilov and many, many others, whose discoveries and inventions put our country in a leading position in the most important areas of progress for a great many years.  Examples of such active patriotism should become an inspiring force for the younger generation, attract children with knowledge, and inspire them to study subjects like physics, chemistry, biology in depth from an early age, and, that way raise a new impressive generation of scientific leaders who will successfully ensure the technological sovereignty of Russia. And I would like to elaborate on support and promotion opportunities for personnel, those specialists who work with young people locally. When performing such important work, they should feel the attention and support of the federal and regional authorities. Colleagues, I would like you to focus on this. The conditions of their work and the resources they are provided with must correspond to the high importance of the jobs they do.  Before getting down to the discussion, I would like to wish all of the State Council members, staff members, and all regional teams a Happy New Year.

            "{'date': '2022-12-22T19:30:00', 'persons': [], 'transcript_unfiltered': \"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Please. Yulia Bubnova: Good afternoon. TASS Agency, Yulia Bubnova. To be honest, I would like to start with some summing up. Clearly, it was not the easiest year, and not the most ordinary, but what are its main results for you? What have we achieved, perhaps, what did we fail to achieve, and how do you see our future, where are we going and where should we arrive? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: There are no ideal situations. Ideal situations only happen in plans, on paper, and you always want something more. But in general, I think that Russia made it through the year quite confidently. We have no concerns that the current situation will prevent us from implementing our plans for the future, including for 2023. Let me repeat once again, we believe – I want to stress this – that everything that is happening, and everything connected with the special military operation, is an absolutely forced and necessary measure. We should be grateful to our military, our troops, officers, our soldiers for what they are doing for Russia, defending its interests, sovereignty and, above all, protecting our people. They act with dignity and achieve what the country needs. As for the economy, as you know, despite the collapses, devastation and catastrophe predicted for us in the economic sphere, nothing like that is happening. Moreover, Russia is performing much better than many G20 countries, and doing so confidently. This applies to the main macroeconomic indicators and the GDP. Yes, there has been a small drop. I said it quite recently: 2.9 percent, according to our and international experts. Now they are giving another figure, even smaller: 2.5. The unemployment rate is a key indicator worldwide. In Russia, it is below the pre-pandemic period: let me remind you, then it was 4.7 percent, and now it is at 3.8–3.9 percent. That is, the labour market is stable. Public finances are stable, there are no alarming details here either. This result did not just fall into our laps. It is the result of the work of the Government, regional teams, businesses, and sentiment in society, which is showing unity and a desire to work together to achieve common goals. Therefore, in general, we feel confident, and I have no doubt that every goal we set will be achieved. Konstantin Panyushkin: Good afternoon. Konstantin Panyushkin, Channel One. In the wake of the State Council, if you will. How would you personally assess the results of the implementation of youth policy this year, considering the dignified way Russian youth have conducted themselves since February 24? Vladimir Putin: You know, we always talk about this – well, not us, but look at our classical literature: it is always about fathers and children, it is always a question of young people in any period of the country’s development – and, indeed, I think the same is happening all over the world – young people are constantly accused of being superficial, unworthy of something, that everything was better before. On the contrary, I believe that young people are always better. Remember the hardest trials at all times in our history. Everyone said, “No, that was then, now they could not do it.” But what can they not do? Young people can do everything. There are different types in all age groups. But in general, our young people show, primarily, a striving for progress, they demonstrate a high level of education, training, understanding of the ongoing processes in the world, in society, and an understanding of where to go, what has true value, what you need to rely on. I am talking about our history, love for the homeland, for our Fatherland. This is especially pronounced during times of trial.  Recall our difficult events in the North Caucasus. People did not think much of our youth. But recall the paratroopers from Pskov – this is an example of what young people can do, how heroically they can behave. And now look at how young people are fighting and how our youth are responding to what is happening in the zone of the special military operation, how they are supporting our fighters. I went to the Manezh today, and I was close to tears when I saw how young people in their teens and a little older were collecting things, writing letters. There were also many volunteers that were young as well.  Yes, people are different. There are people who got into their cars and silently drove away, yes. But on the whole, I want to repeat that Russia’s young people – and I can say this with confidence – are demonstrating love for their land, a desire to fight for it and move forward individually and as a country. Andrei Kolesnikov: Good afternoon. Kommersant newspaper. Mr President, you did not give your Address to the Federal Assembly this year and, apparently, there will not be one. Like many others, I have written about this, noting that the issue of the address flared up in several formats recently, for instance, at the meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects. It seems, yesterday it was also mentioned at the expanded meeting of the Defence Ministry Board. Could you explain why this is the case this year? And what does the future hold for your address? Vladimir Putin: I think there was no address in 2017, either. I am referring to the calendar year. But there should be. What is the problem? The problem is these are fast-moving events, the situation is developing very rapidly. Therefore, it was very difficult – probably not very, but rather difficult to pin down results at a specific moment and specific plans for the near future. We will do that early next year, without a doubt. But the point of the address lies in what I have just said. It has been reflected in my statements one way or another. It was impossible not to talk about it. So, frankly, it was rather difficult for me and the Executive Office to squeeze this into a formal address without a lot of repetition, and that is it. In other words, I have already spoken about key things in one way or another, so there was not much desire to collect it all again and repeat what I had already said. For something substantial, we need time and additional analysis of what is happening, what we are talking about and planning for the near future. We will do this. I will not mention exact dates but we will certainly do this in the coming year.  Kseniya Golovanova: Kseniya Golovanova, Interfax. Mr President, I would like to ask you about the agreement on supplying Patriot missile battery to Ukraine reached during Mr Zelensky’s visit to the United States. Is it possible to speak about full US involvement in the conflict in Ukraine? What about the consequences of this decision? For instance, can Russia bring its systems closer to the borders of NATO countries or deploy them in direct proximity to the US? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: You have asked whether it is possible to speak about greater US involvement in the conflict in Ukraine. I think we need to look at the problem more broadly. What do I mean specifically and why? Because the United States has been doing this for a long time – it has long been involved in the processes taking place in the Soviet and post-Soviet space. Back in Soviet times whole institutes worked in Ukraine, and they fully realised the background of the issue. They have experienced, deep specialists who know this professionally. I will repeat, the ground was laid during Soviet times; people were selected, meanings were defined and so on. I don’t want to go into details at this point – this is not the right format where one can go deep into the history of the issue. That said, it is still clear where all this came from. The unity of the Russian world is a very subtle issue. Divide and rule – this slogan was used in ancient times and is still being actively used in real politics. This is why our potential adversary, our opponents have always been dreaming about this and have always been engaged in this. They have been trying to divide us and then run the separate parts. What is new here? The idea of Ukrainian separatism was born by itself long ago, when we were still one country. You know, I have always said that if someone decides that a separate ethnic group has formed and wants to live independently, for God’s sake, it is impossible to ever go against the will of the people. But if this is so, this principle must be universal and it is impossible to ever go against the will of people that feel like they are in a different reality, that consider themselves a part of the Russian people and the Russian world, that believe they are part of this culture, part of this language and part of this history and these traditions. Nobody can fight them, either. But a war was unleashed on them in 2014. I mean a war. This is what it was about. What was it when the centres of million-strong cities were struck from the air? What was it when troops with armour were deployed against them? It was a war, combat operations. We endured all this, endured and endured, in the hope of some peace agreement. Now it turns out that we were simply fooled. So, a country like the United States has been involved in this for a long time. A long time.  In this sense, it is possible to say that by leading us to the current events, they achieved the desired goal. For our part, we had also no other choice than the actions we took late last February. Yes, that was the logic shaping the developments, but our primary goal is to protect people that – let me repeat – feel like they are part of our nation, part of our culture. What did we believe at one time? We believed that okay, the USSR ceased to exist. But, as I said at yesterday’s Defence Ministry Board meeting, we thought our common historical roots, our cultural and spiritual background would be stronger than what pulls us apart, and such forces have always existed. We assumed that what unites us was stronger. But no, it was not so, due to the assistance of outside forces and the fact that people with extreme nationalist views came to power basically after the collapse of the Union. And this division was growing worse all the time with the help of these forces and despite all our efforts. As I once said – at first we were pulled apart, separated and then set against each other. In this sense, they have achieved results, of course, and in this sense it has been something of a fiasco for us. We were left with nothing else. Maybe we were deliberately brought to this, to this brink. But we had nowhere to retreat, this is the problem. They were always fully involved; they did their best. I do not remember now, but you can read up on it in history books. One of the deputies of the tsarist State Duma said, if you want to lose Ukraine, add Galicia to it. And this is what happened in the end; he turned out to be a visionary. Why? Because people from that part behave very aggressively and actually suppress the silent majority in the rest of that territory. But again, we believed that the underlying foundations of our unity would be stronger than the trends that are tearing us apart. But it turned out this was not the case. They began to suppress Russian culture and the Russian language, tried to break our spiritual unity in totally barbaric ways. And they pretended that no one noticed. Why? Because, as I said, their strategy was to divide and rule. A unification of the Russian people is undesirable. No one wants it. On the other hand, our disunity would make them happy; they would gladly continue to rip us apart. But our unification and consolidation are things no one wants – except us, and we will do it and we will succeed. As to the military-technical aspects, the point is that, as I said yesterday, the Admiral Gorshkov frigate will enter combat service in early January, equipped with new weapons systems. It is not that we are planning any provocations, but it is nevertheless a factor in strengthening our strategic forces. These are medium-range systems, but they have such speed characteristics that they can give us certain advantages in this sense. As for the Patriot, it is a pretty old system. I would say it doesn’t work like our S-300. Nevertheless, those who oppose us assume that these systems are defensive weapons. All right. We will just keep that in mind, and there is always an antidote. So those who are doing this, are doing it in vain: it just prolongs the conflict, and that’s that. Konstantin Kokoveshnikov: Good afternoon. Konstantin Kokoveshnikov, Zvezda TV channel. If I may, I have one more question about the special military operation. As usual, you have said very little about the course of the operation, preferring not to speak about the details. However, do you see any signs of the conflict becoming drawn out? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: You know, I have already spoken about this. The situation actually started developing – this was less perceptible here, while the West preferred not to speak or notice anything – way back in 2014, after the coup d’état that was instigated by the United States, when cookies were handed out on Maidan. I have spoken about this many times. But our goal is not to whip up the military conflict but to end this war. This is what we want, and this is what we will try to do.  As for me speaking little or sparingly about it, this is logical. On the one hand, I may be sparing words, but the Defence Ministry holds daily briefings to report to the public and the country about what is going on, where this is taking place, in what manner and so on. In short, we will do our best to end this, and the sooner, the better, of course. As for what and how this is taking place, I have noted on numerous occasions that the intensification of the conflict will lead to unjustified losses. Many a little makes a mickle. Alexei Petrov: Alexei Petrov, Rossiya TV channel. Mr President, my question essentially follows up on this theme. Western political quarters have recently been saying, including in NATO, that the Western resources which are being provided to Ukraine as assistance are not unlimited; in fact, they are running out. At the same time, some Western experts believe that Russia’s resources are down to the last missiles, munitions and so on.  We have heard this before, but, nevertheless, what is the situation in our defence industry? Can it replenish the resources we need, on the one hand, and produce enough for continuing the special military operation, on the other hand?  Thank you. Vladimir Putin: First of all, I do not think that the resources of Western countries and NATO members have been stretched thin. It is another matter that Ukraine is being supplied with weapons of the former Warsaw Pact countries, the majority of which are Soviet-made. This resource is running out indeed; we have destroyed and burned almost all of these weapons. There is only something like a few dozen armoured vehicles and a hundred of other weapon systems left. We have destroyed a lot of them. The stock of these systems is almost exhausted. But this does not mean that Western countries and NATO do not have other weapons. They do have them. However, it is not easy to convert to new weapon systems, including NATO-standard ones. This requires preparation time, personnel training, stocks of spare parts, maintenance and repair. It is a big and complicated issue. This is my first point. Second, there is also the question of the Western defence industry capabilities. The US defence sector is large and can be drummed up, but this will not be easy there either, because this involves additional allocations, and the allocation of funds is part of the budget process. It is not a simple matter. It is said that the Patriot systems may be sent to Ukraine. Let them do it; we will weed out the Patriots too. And they will have to send something to replace them with or create new systems. It is a long and complicated process. It is not all that simple. We take this into account and count everything that is being sent there, how many systems there are in the depots, how many more they can manufacture and how fast, and if they can train the necessary personnel. Now to our capabilities and resources. We are spending them, of course. I will not provide figures here, for example, how many shells we are using a day. The figures are high. But the difference between us and those who are fighting us is that the Ukrainian defence industry is rapidly moving towards zero if not a negative figure. All of its manufacturing capabilities will be destroyed soon, whereas our framework is being expanded. As I pointed out at the Defence Ministry Board meeting yesterday, we will not do this to the detriment of the other economic sectors. We must provide for the army anyway, one way or another, as the Minister said yesterday. Unlike Ukraine, we have been developing our industry, including the defence sector over the past decades. We have been developing out military science and technology. There are some elements lacking, like loitering munitions, drones and the like, but we have been working on that. We know which enterprises can produce them, how many and how soon. We have the funds for financing research and technology centres and manufacturing capacities. We have all of that. Yes, there is a problem with building up production speed and volumes. But we can do it, and we will certainly do it. Aisel Gereykhanova: Aisel Gereykhanova, Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Mr President, in this situation, is there a real chance for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine situation? Is it possible? Vladimir Putin: Every conflict, every armed conflict ends with some kind of negotiations on the diplomatic track, one way or another, and we have never refused to negotiate. It is the Ukrainian leadership that has forbidden itself to negotiate. This attitude is somewhat unusual, even bizarre, I would say. Nevertheless, sooner or later, any parties that are in a state of conflict sit down and negotiate. The sooner this realisation comes to those who oppose us, the better. We have never given up on that. Valery Sanfirov: Valery Sanfirov, Vesti FM. Mr President, you have been meeting frequently with the military of late. Vladimir Putin: Does this surprise you? Valery Sanfirov: No. Vladimir Putin: Every day, so that you understand, every day. Valery Sanfirov: A question about heroes. You have passed Kutuzovsky Prospekt as you were traveling to this State Council meeting; the streets in that area are named after General Dorokhov, Rayevsky, Barclay de Tolly, and Vasilisa Kozhina. Even the State Council meeting took place in a hall with some 11,000 plaques with the names of St George decorated heroes, if I am not mistaken. Is the special military operation producing national heroes and commanders? Are any new names appearing? Vladimir Putin: Yes, of course. Unfortunately, any armed conflict is associated with losses, with tragedies, injuries and so on. And as a rule, you know, those who die while defending the interests of their Fatherland, their Motherland, their people, those who receive injuries – they are the strongest. They are at the forefront. And of course, they are heroes. I have said this many times. This is my personal deep conviction. Just think about it: you and I are standing here in this hall at the Kremlin Palace; we are warm, with the artificial sun shining above us; the lights are on, the interior is beautiful – and the soldiers are out there in the snow. Do you see? We talk about the insoles in their boots and so on, about their weapons – but they can come under fire at any moment. Of course, they are all heroes. They are putting in a tremendous effort, risking their health and lives. Of course, they are heroes. Some of them commit special acts, acts that are referred to as heroism, personal heroism. Not just hard work, but personal heroism. We think about this, of course, and we will definitely find a way to present them as role models for our entire society, as an example for the younger generation to follow. These people are strengthening the inner spirit of the nation. This is very important. We certainly have them. There are a lot of them. You probably know some of them; others we do not know yet, we do not have their names yet, but we will list them for sure. Maria Glebova: Maria Glebova, RIA Novosti. If I may, I would like to get back to the economy. You said earlier that the economy has not collapsed. But now we hear that the main blow will come next year. Could you please tell us whether it will be possible to keep the Russian economy afloat? Also, at the end of each year, you meet with Russian business leaders. But not this year. Why is that? Do you see their role in the growth of private investment now? I would also like to bring up social matters. Will all social commitments that were made continue to be met? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: As for the economy, I have already touched upon this topic, but have something to add. First, the predicted economic collapse did not happen. True, we have posted a decline, and I will repeat the figures. There have been promises – or predictions or hopes maybe – that Russia’s economy will contract. Some said its GDP would drop by 20 percent or more, by 20–25 percent. True, there is a decline in GDP, but not 20–25 percent; it is in fact 2.5 percent. That is the first thing. Second. Inflation, as I said, will be a little more than 12 percent this year – it is one of the most important indicators, too. This, I think, is much better than in many other countries, including the G20 countries. Inflation is not good of course, but it being smaller than in other countries is good. Next year – we have mentioned this, too – we will strive for the 4–5 percent target, based on the economy's performance in the first quarter – at least, we hope so. And this is a very good trend, unlike in some other G20 countries, where inflation is on the rise. Unemployment is at a historic low of 3.8 percent. We are running a budget deficit, this is true, but it is only 2 percent this year, next year too, then it is projected at one percent, and less than one percent in 2025: we are expecting about 0.8 percent. I would like to point out that other countries – both large developing economies and the so-called developed market economies – are running a much greater deficit. In the United States, I think, it is 5.7 percent, and in China, it is over 7 percent. All major economies are running deficits above 5 percent. We are not. This is a good foundation for moving confidently into 2023. Our priority for 2023 will be the development of infrastructure. I do not think I need to list all the projects, we have a lot: the Eastern Operating Domain project, the North-South corridor, and other infrastructure projects across the country (just recently Marat Khusnullin reported on road construction) and so on. Airports, ports, a lot of other projects. Next, we also need to deal with financial issues. What do I mean? The country’s financial system is stable, banks are reliable and operate without disruptions, which is thanks to the Government and bank employees who work very hard and know their jobs very well. They are highly qualified people who manage many things, if not everything. We must maintain macroeconomic stability. We will not allow any uncontrollable spending but, as I said, will move towards achieving the main macroeconomic indicators that can support the economic stability in general.  I spoke about infrastructure. The next important aspect is maintaining the stability of the financial system, the banking system and the budget. It is important to do a very important thing, which is to substitute the investment that participants in the economic activity relied on before, including some Western institutions, foundations and so on, with sources inside the country. They must be substituted with domestic funding. Of course, we can do it by engaging various instruments. I do not want to go into detail. If you are asking a question about the economy, your readers most likely know what they are. They exist and must be developed. It is not a simple matter but it is possible.  Of course, we must resolve the main issue, which is increasing real wages. It is absolutely obvious. Considering the inflation and the budget revenues, we are able to make a step in this direction. We have an entire set of economic measures we must take. I have no doubt that all of them are achievable. Results of the next year will show how we can fulfil these plans and get closer to solving these tasks.  Maria Glebova: What about large businesses? Vladimir Putin: Large businesses. You see, I always enjoy meeting with my colleagues although now COVID is on the rise again, along with swine flu. It is the only problem. I mean I could meet with them like I am meeting with you, but they have to gather in one place. They may pose certain risks to each other in terms of the epidemiological situation. It is the only problem. At any rate, we maintain constant contact and will continue to develop this dialogue.  They are going through difficult times. You see, there are different people. We know that well, the country knows it. First of all, they were all subjected to sanctions. Western, pro-Western or not, they were subjected to the sanctions indiscriminately. What for? To force businesses to confront the government. But people living in this country must serve the country’s interests. And the country is interested in them working effectively and paying taxes. They do not have to have a boat seized abroad or a castle on the Mediterranean Sea or in London.  You see, the point is, if a person lives here and associates their life, the life of their children and family with this country, it is one thing. But if a person does not associate their life with this country and simply takes money from here to build a life abroad, it means they do not value the country where they live and earn money but instead value their good relationships in the place where their property and bank accounts are. This kind of people pose a danger to us.  But we are non-judgmental, as long as they work effectively. We maintain and we will continue to maintain our contacts. I want to note that maybe not 100 percent, not everyone, but most representatives of business, including large businesses, are patriots of our country, patriots of Russia. Every person has their own individual circumstances, but all of them are striving not to just live and work in Russia, but to work in the interests of our country, maintain their staff, enterprises, develop the economy, etc. Nakhid Babayev: Good afternoon, Mr President. My name in Nakhid Babayev, NTV. I would like to talk more about the economy. Is Russia suffering losses after the price cap on Russian oil was adopted? Has the oil sector asked the state for help, concessions? Hence the next question. Much is being said about the response measures, and an executive order is being developed. Will the measures outlined by it be able to protect our interests? Vladimir Putin: You know, I think I will sign the executive order next Monday or Tuesday. These are preventive measures, because there is no obvious damage to Russia, the Russian economy or the Russian fuel and energy sector. We are selling oil at approximately the same prices as this cap. Yes, the goal of our geopolitical opponents and adversaries is to reduce the income to the Russian budget, but we are not losing anything because of this cap. The Russian fuel and energy sector, the budget and the economy are not incurring losses, because we already sell oil at this price. But what is important is that they are trying to bring new tools, not characteristic of the market economy, to the global economy. The customer, the buyer is trying to introduce new, non-market regulation to be used in theory and practice in the entire world. Imagine this: you want to go to a dealer to buy a car, say, a Mercedes or a Chevrolet. You go there and say, “I will buy it for five rubles, no more.” Okay. You buy one, two, three cars, and then the Mercedes factory will close, because the production of Mercedes or Chevrolet cars will not be profitable anymore. It is the same in the energy sector, completely the same thing. This sector already lacks investment. There are problems related to the fact that money is not invested in new projects such as pipelines, production and development due to environmental concerns and the transition to renewable energy sources. Banks do not loan money, and insurance companies refuse to issue policies. Large global companies have stopped investing in the volume the global energy sector needs. And now they are trying to administratively set a price cap. This is the road toward destroying the global energy sector. The moment might come when the underinvested sector stops providing the necessary volume of products and the prices will soar and hurt those who are trying to introduce these instruments. Therefore, energy producers, oil producers in this case, take it personally, referring to themselves, not Russia, but themselves because everyone believes that this is the first attempt to dictate administrative rules of price regulation to producers, and more will follow. Alexei Lazurenko: Alexei Lazurenko, Izvestia. I would like to follow up on the same subject. Similar decisions to cap gas prices were adopted several days ago. What will we do in this context? How big of a threat is this for us, and what will be the future of the Nord Stream pipelines? Vladimir Putin: This initiative follows the same pattern, as far as I can tell. Once again, we are witnessing an attempt to use administrative leverage to regulate prices. Nothing good can come out of this for gas or oil markets. Overall, sometimes our colleagues and partners really surprise me by how unprofessional they are. There was a time when it was the European Commission which forced us to switch to market pricing and to setting the price of natural gas on the commodity exchange. We, in turn, and I personally, tried to persuade Brussels not to do it, saying that this is not how the gas market works and would have grave consequences, resulting in surging prices. This is exactly what is happening right now. Now they do not know how to get out of this situation and are trying to regulate the price of gas too. However, there is a slight difference compared to the way they try regulating oil prices. This time, the European Commission is focusing on regulating commodity exchanges. They are pegging gas prices to LNG, saying that gas prices must correlate with LNG pricing, etc. Still, this is an attempt to use administrative methods for regulating prices. You know, they do not listen to us, they do not want to deal with us, they do not like us and want to counter us. Fine, but what about listening to themselves? I am referring to those trying to regulate gas prices in Europe. They always take their cues from the Americans, bowing and humiliating themselves every time they are ordered to do something. This time, there were no orders, but they could have listened to what the US experts are saying. Take Friedman, a prominent economist and Nobel Prize winner. He said that if you want to create a shortage of tomatoes, just cap the price of tomatoes. Instantly you'll have a tomato shortage. They are doing the same with oil and gas – exactly the same. For some reason, no one is listening. We have been keeping a close eye on these developments, watching them. If the system they propose tilts towards administrative regulation and runs counter to Gazprom’s contracts with its counterparts, or if there is any interference in these contracts, we reserve the right to consider whether we have an obligation to perform these contracts while the other party infringes on them. As for the Nord Streams…. What can I say? This was a terrorist attack, which is obvious, and everyone has recognised this. Even more surprising is that it is an act of international, or should I say state terrorism. Why? Because individuals cannot carry out terror attacks of this kind on their own. States were clearly involved in perpetrating them. As they say in such cases: look for who will benefit. Who will benefit from Russian gas being supplied to Europe only through Ukraine, who will benefit from Ukraine receiving the money? The aggressor is Russia, but they receive money from us for transit, and we are paying them, though they call us aggressors, and though they are aggressors in relation to Donbass, too. We are countering aggression, not the other way around. They take money and that is alright. Money is money. Who benefits from Russian gas being supplied to Europe only through Ukraine? That is who blew it up. Nobody is investigating. We had an opportunity just once to inspect the sites of explosions. All this was in the media, there is nothing to repeat, as I am sure you already know this. But there is no real investigation, no one is investigating. It is astonishing but true. As for oil and gas, do you know what occurred to me right now during our conversation? I have already talked about this once, but I think it will be difficult to disagree with what I am about to say. Look, they are trying to put a price cap on energy resources, on oil and gas. Who produces them? Russia, Arab countries, Latin America, Asia, Indonesia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE produce oil, too. The United States produces both oil and gas, but they consume everything: they have little left for the external market. That is, it is produced in those countries, but consumed in Europe and in the United States. I believe that what they are trying to do now is a remnant of colonialism. They are used to robbing other countries. Indeed, to a large extent, the rise of European countries’ economies is based on slave trade and robbery of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. To a large extent, the prosperity of the United States grew out of the slave trade and the use of slave labour, and then, of course, as a result of the First and Second World Wars, which is obvious. But they are used to robbing others. And an attempt at non-market regulation in the sphere of the economy is the same colonial robbery, or, in any case, an attempt at colonial robbery. But the world has changed and they are unlikely to be able to do it today. Alexander Yunashev: Mr President, good afternoon. Alexander Yunashev, Life. I would like to ask you how the events of recent months have changed your life and daily routine? Do you find the time to exercise? Next week is New Year, so I would like to wish you happy holidays and ask how you will spend them? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. There is nothing out of the ordinary here. I will celebrate this New Year with my family, with people who are dear to me, and I will watch the President's speech, the address. As for sports, I do continue to exercise. I believe that this is just a way to stay in shape, and I must stay fit for work. It is like a pill that makes you feel good and work well. I wish everyone had this attitude to sports: it is a good thing. They say that it also helps stay fit mentally: a sound mind in a sound body. Thank you, too.  Have wonderful holidays! My best wishes.\", 'kremlin_id': 70170, 'place': 'The Kremlin, Moscow', 'title': 'Vladimir Putin answered questions from journalists', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin answered a range of topical questions from journalists.', 'tags': ['Media'], 'transcript_filtered': \"Please. There are no ideal situations. Ideal situations only happen in plans, on paper, and you always want something more. But in general, I think that Russia made it through the year quite confidently. We have no concerns that the current situation will prevent us from implementing our plans for the future, including for 2023. Let me repeat once again, we believe – I want to stress this – that everything that is happening, and everything connected with the special military operation, is an absolutely forced and necessary measure. We should be grateful to our military, our troops, officers, our soldiers for what they are doing for Russia, defending its interests, sovereignty and, above all, protecting our people. They act with dignity and achieve what the country needs. As for the economy, as you know, despite the collapses, devastation and catastrophe predicted for us in the economic sphere, nothing like that is happening. Moreover, Russia is performing much better than many G20 countries, and doing so confidently. This applies to the main macroeconomic indicators and the GDP. Yes, there has been a small drop. I said it quite recently: 2.9 percent, according to our and international experts. Now they are giving another figure, even smaller: 2.5. The unemployment rate is a key indicator worldwide. In Russia, it is below the pre-pandemic period: let me remind you, then it was 4.7 percent, and now it is at 3.8–3.9 percent. That is, the labour market is stable. Public finances are stable, there are no alarming details here either. This result did not just fall into our laps. It is the result of the work of the Government, regional teams, businesses, and sentiment in society, which is showing unity and a desire to work together to achieve common goals. Therefore, in general, we feel confident, and I have no doubt that every goal we set will be achieved. You know, we always talk about this – well, not us, but look at our classical literature: it is always about fathers and children, it is always a question of young people in any period of the country’s development – and, indeed, I think the same is happening all over the world – young people are constantly accused of being superficial, unworthy of something, that everything was better before. On the contrary, I believe that young people are always better. Remember the hardest trials at all times in our history. Everyone said, “No, that was then, now they could not do it.” But what can they not do? Young people can do everything. There are different types in all age groups. But in general, our young people show, primarily, a striving for progress, they demonstrate a high level of education, training, understanding of the ongoing processes in the world, in society, and an understanding of where to go, what has true value, what you need to rely on. I am talking about our history, love for the homeland, for our Fatherland. This is especially pronounced during times of trial.  Recall our difficult events in the North Caucasus. People did not think much of our youth. But recall the paratroopers from Pskov – this is an example of what young people can do, how heroically they can behave. And now look at how young people are fighting and how our youth are responding to what is happening in the zone of the special military operation, how they are supporting our fighters. I went to the Manezh today, and I was close to tears when I saw how young people in their teens and a little older were collecting things, writing letters. There were also many volunteers that were young as well.  Yes, people are different. There are people who got into their cars and silently drove away, yes. But on the whole, I want to repeat that Russia’s young people – and I can say this with confidence – are demonstrating love for their land, a desire to fight for it and move forward individually and as a country. I think there was no address in 2017, either. I am referring to the calendar year. But there should be. What is the problem? The problem is these are fast-moving events, the situation is developing very rapidly. Therefore, it was very difficult – probably not very, but rather difficult to pin down results at a specific moment and specific plans for the near future. We will do that early next year, without a doubt. But the point of the address lies in what I have just said. It has been reflected in my statements one way or another. It was impossible not to talk about it. So, frankly, it was rather difficult for me and the Executive Office to squeeze this into a formal address without a lot of repetition, and that is it. In other words, I have already spoken about key things in one way or another, so there was not much desire to collect it all again and repeat what I had already said. For something substantial, we need time and additional analysis of what is happening, what we are talking about and planning for the near future. We will do this. I will not mention exact dates but we will certainly do this in the coming year.  You have asked whether it is possible to speak about greater US involvement in the conflict in Ukraine. I think we need to look at the problem more broadly. What do I mean specifically and why? Because the United States has been doing this for a long time – it has long been involved in the processes taking place in the Soviet and post-Soviet space. Back in Soviet times whole institutes worked in Ukraine, and they fully realised the background of the issue. They have experienced, deep specialists who know this professionally. I will repeat, the ground was laid during Soviet times; people were selected, meanings were defined and so on. I don’t want to go into details at this point – this is not the right format where one can go deep into the history of the issue. That said, it is still clear where all this came from. The unity of the Russian world is a very subtle issue. Divide and rule – this slogan was used in ancient times and is still being actively used in real politics. This is why our potential adversary, our opponents have always been dreaming about this and have always been engaged in this. They have been trying to divide us and then run the separate parts. What is new here? The idea of Ukrainian separatism was born by itself long ago, when we were still one country. You know, I have always said that if someone decides that a separate ethnic group has formed and wants to live independently, for God’s sake, it is impossible to ever go against the will of the people. But if this is so, this principle must be universal and it is impossible to ever go against the will of people that feel like they are in a different reality, that consider themselves a part of the Russian people and the Russian world, that believe they are part of this culture, part of this language and part of this history and these traditions. Nobody can fight them, either. But a war was unleashed on them in 2014. I mean a war. This is what it was about. What was it when the centres of million-strong cities were struck from the air? What was it when troops with armour were deployed against them? It was a war, combat operations. We endured all this, endured and endured, in the hope of some peace agreement. Now it turns out that we were simply fooled. So, a country like the United States has been involved in this for a long time. A long time.  In this sense, it is possible to say that by leading us to the current events, they achieved the desired goal. For our part, we had also no other choice than the actions we took late last February. Yes, that was the logic shaping the developments, but our primary goal is to protect people that – let me repeat – feel like they are part of our nation, part of our culture. What did we believe at one time? We believed that okay, the USSR ceased to exist. But, as I said at yesterday’s Defence Ministry Board meeting, we thought our common historical roots, our cultural and spiritual background would be stronger than what pulls us apart, and such forces have always existed. We assumed that what unites us was stronger. But no, it was not so, due to the assistance of outside forces and the fact that people with extreme nationalist views came to power basically after the collapse of the Union. And this division was growing worse all the time with the help of these forces and despite all our efforts. As I once said – at first we were pulled apart, separated and then set against each other. In this sense, they have achieved results, of course, and in this sense it has been something of a fiasco for us. We were left with nothing else. Maybe we were deliberately brought to this, to this brink. But we had nowhere to retreat, this is the problem. They were always fully involved; they did their best. I do not remember now, but you can read up on it in history books. One of the deputies of the tsarist State Duma said, if you want to lose Ukraine, add Galicia to it. And this is what happened in the end; he turned out to be a visionary. Why? Because people from that part behave very aggressively and actually suppress the silent majority in the rest of that territory. But again, we believed that the underlying foundations of our unity would be stronger than the trends that are tearing us apart. But it turned out this was not the case. They began to suppress Russian culture and the Russian language, tried to break our spiritual unity in totally barbaric ways. And they pretended that no one noticed. Why? Because, as I said, their strategy was to divide and rule. A unification of the Russian people is undesirable. No one wants it. On the other hand, our disunity would make them happy; they would gladly continue to rip us apart. But our unification and consolidation are things no one wants – except us, and we will do it and we will succeed. As to the military-technical aspects, the point is that, as I said yesterday, the Admiral Gorshkov frigate will enter combat service in early January, equipped with new weapons systems. It is not that we are planning any provocations, but it is nevertheless a factor in strengthening our strategic forces. These are medium-range systems, but they have such speed characteristics that they can give us certain advantages in this sense. As for the Patriot, it is a pretty old system. I would say it doesn’t work like our S-300. Nevertheless, those who oppose us assume that these systems are defensive weapons. All right. We will just keep that in mind, and there is always an antidote. So those who are doing this, are doing it in vain: it just prolongs the conflict, and that’s that. You know, I have already spoken about this. The situation actually started developing – this was less perceptible here, while the West preferred not to speak or notice anything – way back in 2014, after the coup d’état that was instigated by the United States, when cookies were handed out on Maidan. I have spoken about this many times. But our goal is not to whip up the military conflict but to end this war. This is what we want, and this is what we will try to do.  As for me speaking little or sparingly about it, this is logical. On the one hand, I may be sparing words, but the Defence Ministry holds daily briefings to report to the public and the country about what is going on, where this is taking place, in what manner and so on. In short, we will do our best to end this, and the sooner, the better, of course. As for what and how this is taking place, I have noted on numerous occasions that the intensification of the conflict will lead to unjustified losses. Many a little makes a mickle. First of all, I do not think that the resources of Western countries and NATO members have been stretched thin. It is another matter that Ukraine is being supplied with weapons of the former Warsaw Pact countries, the majority of which are Soviet-made. This resource is running out indeed; we have destroyed and burned almost all of these weapons. There is only something like a few dozen armoured vehicles and a hundred of other weapon systems left. We have destroyed a lot of them. The stock of these systems is almost exhausted. But this does not mean that Western countries and NATO do not have other weapons. They do have them. However, it is not easy to convert to new weapon systems, including NATO-standard ones. This requires preparation time, personnel training, stocks of spare parts, maintenance and repair. It is a big and complicated issue. This is my first point. Second, there is also the question of the Western defence industry capabilities. The US defence sector is large and can be drummed up, but this will not be easy there either, because this involves additional allocations, and the allocation of funds is part of the budget process. It is not a simple matter. It is said that the Patriot systems may be sent to Ukraine. Let them do it; we will weed out the Patriots too. And they will have to send something to replace them with or create new systems. It is a long and complicated process. It is not all that simple. We take this into account and count everything that is being sent there, how many systems there are in the depots, how many more they can manufacture and how fast, and if they can train the necessary personnel. Now to our capabilities and resources. We are spending them, of course. I will not provide figures here, for example, how many shells we are using a day. The figures are high. But the difference between us and those who are fighting us is that the Ukrainian defence industry is rapidly moving towards zero if not a negative figure. All of its manufacturing capabilities will be destroyed soon, whereas our framework is being expanded. As I pointed out at the Defence Ministry Board meeting yesterday, we will not do this to the detriment of the other economic sectors. We must provide for the army anyway, one way or another, as the Minister said yesterday. Unlike Ukraine, we have been developing our industry, including the defence sector over the past decades. We have been developing out military science and technology. There are some elements lacking, like loitering munitions, drones and the like, but we have been working on that. We know which enterprises can produce them, how many and how soon. We have the funds for financing research and technology centres and manufacturing capacities. We have all of that. Yes, there is a problem with building up production speed and volumes. But we can do it, and we will certainly do it. Every conflict, every armed conflict ends with some kind of negotiations on the diplomatic track, one way or another, and we have never refused to negotiate. It is the Ukrainian leadership that has forbidden itself to negotiate. This attitude is somewhat unusual, even bizarre, I would say. Nevertheless, sooner or later, any parties that are in a state of conflict sit down and negotiate. The sooner this realisation comes to those who oppose us, the better. We have never given up on that. Does this surprise you? Every day, so that you understand, every day. Yes, of course. Unfortunately, any armed conflict is associated with losses, with tragedies, injuries and so on. And as a rule, you know, those who die while defending the interests of their Fatherland, their Motherland, their people, those who receive injuries – they are the strongest. They are at the forefront. And of course, they are heroes. I have said this many times. This is my personal deep conviction. Just think about it: you and I are standing here in this hall at the Kremlin Palace; we are warm, with the artificial sun shining above us; the lights are on, the interior is beautiful – and the soldiers are out there in the snow. Do you see? We talk about the insoles in their boots and so on, about their weapons – but they can come under fire at any moment. Of course, they are all heroes. They are putting in a tremendous effort, risking their health and lives. Of course, they are heroes. Some of them commit special acts, acts that are referred to as heroism, personal heroism. Not just hard work, but personal heroism. We think about this, of course, and we will definitely find a way to present them as role models for our entire society, as an example for the younger generation to follow. These people are strengthening the inner spirit of the nation. This is very important. We certainly have them. There are a lot of them. You probably know some of them; others we do not know yet, we do not have their names yet, but we will list them for sure. As for the economy, I have already touched upon this topic, but have something to add. First, the predicted economic collapse did not happen. True, we have posted a decline, and I will repeat the figures. There have been promises – or predictions or hopes maybe – that Russia’s economy will contract. Some said its GDP would drop by 20 percent or more, by 20–25 percent. True, there is a decline in GDP, but not 20–25 percent; it is in fact 2.5 percent. That is the first thing. Second. Inflation, as I said, will be a little more than 12 percent this year – it is one of the most important indicators, too. This, I think, is much better than in many other countries, including the G20 countries. Inflation is not good of course, but it being smaller than in other countries is good. Next year – we have mentioned this, too – we will strive for the 4–5 percent target, based on the economy's performance in the first quarter – at least, we hope so. And this is a very good trend, unlike in some other G20 countries, where inflation is on the rise. Unemployment is at a historic low of 3.8 percent. We are running a budget deficit, this is true, but it is only 2 percent this year, next year too, then it is projected at one percent, and less than one percent in 2025: we are expecting about 0.8 percent. I would like to point out that other countries – both large developing economies and the so-called developed market economies – are running a much greater deficit. In the United States, I think, it is 5.7 percent, and in China, it is over 7 percent. All major economies are running deficits above 5 percent. We are not. This is a good foundation for moving confidently into 2023. Our priority for 2023 will be the development of infrastructure. I do not think I need to list all the projects, we have a lot: the Eastern Operating Domain project, the North-South corridor, and other infrastructure projects across the country (just recently Marat Khusnullin reported on road construction) and so on. Airports, ports, a lot of other projects. Next, we also need to deal with financial issues. What do I mean? The country’s financial system is stable, banks are reliable and operate without disruptions, which is thanks to the Government and bank employees who work very hard and know their jobs very well. They are highly qualified people who manage many things, if not everything. We must maintain macroeconomic stability. We will not allow any uncontrollable spending but, as I said, will move towards achieving the main macroeconomic indicators that can support the economic stability in general.  I spoke about infrastructure. The next important aspect is maintaining the stability of the financial system, the banking system and the budget. It is important to do a very important thing, which is to substitute the investment that participants in the economic activity relied on before, including some Western institutions, foundations and so on, with sources inside the country. They must be substituted with domestic funding. Of course, we can do it by engaging various instruments. I do not want to go into detail. If you are asking a question about the economy, your readers most likely know what they are. They exist and must be developed. It is not a simple matter but it is possible.  Of course, we must resolve the main issue, which is increasing real wages. It is absolutely obvious. Considering the inflation and the budget revenues, we are able to make a step in this direction. We have an entire set of economic measures we must take. I have no doubt that all of them are achievable. Results of the next year will show how we can fulfil these plans and get closer to solving these tasks.  Large businesses. You see, I always enjoy meeting with my colleagues although now COVID is on the rise again, along with swine flu. It is the only problem. I mean I could meet with them like I am meeting with you, but they have to gather in one place. They may pose certain risks to each other in terms of the epidemiological situation. It is the only problem. At any rate, we maintain constant contact and will continue to develop this dialogue.  They are going through difficult times. You see, there are different people. We know that well, the country knows it. First of all, they were all subjected to sanctions. Western, pro-Western or not, they were subjected to the sanctions indiscriminately. What for? To force businesses to confront the government. But people living in this country must serve the country’s interests. And the country is interested in them working effectively and paying taxes. They do not have to have a boat seized abroad or a castle on the Mediterranean Sea or in London.  You see, the point is, if a person lives here and associates their life, the life of their children and family with this country, it is one thing. But if a person does not associate their life with this country and simply takes money from here to build a life abroad, it means they do not value the country where they live and earn money but instead value their good relationships in the place where their property and bank accounts are. This kind of people pose a danger to us.  But we are non-judgmental, as long as they work effectively. We maintain and we will continue to maintain our contacts. I want to note that maybe not 100 percent, not everyone, but most representatives of business, including large businesses, are patriots of our country, patriots of Russia. Every person has their own individual circumstances, but all of them are striving not to just live and work in Russia, but to work in the interests of our country, maintain their staff, enterprises, develop the economy, etc. You know, I think I will sign the executive order next Monday or Tuesday. These are preventive measures, because there is no obvious damage to Russia, the Russian economy or the Russian fuel and energy sector. We are selling oil at approximately the same prices as this cap. Yes, the goal of our geopolitical opponents and adversaries is to reduce the income to the Russian budget, but we are not losing anything because of this cap. The Russian fuel and energy sector, the budget and the economy are not incurring losses, because we already sell oil at this price. But what is important is that they are trying to bring new tools, not characteristic of the market economy, to the global economy. The customer, the buyer is trying to introduce new, non-market regulation to be used in theory and practice in the entire world. Imagine this: you want to go to a dealer to buy a car, say, a Mercedes or a Chevrolet. You go there and say, “I will buy it for five rubles, no more.” Okay. You buy one, two, three cars, and then the Mercedes factory will close, because the production of Mercedes or Chevrolet cars will not be profitable anymore. It is the same in the energy sector, completely the same thing. This sector already lacks investment. There are problems related to the fact that money is not invested in new projects such as pipelines, production and development due to environmental concerns and the transition to renewable energy sources. Banks do not loan money, and insurance companies refuse to issue policies. Large global companies have stopped investing in the volume the global energy sector needs. And now they are trying to administratively set a price cap. This is the road toward destroying the global energy sector. The moment might come when the underinvested sector stops providing the necessary volume of products and the prices will soar and hurt those who are trying to introduce these instruments. Therefore, energy producers, oil producers in this case, take it personally, referring to themselves, not Russia, but themselves because everyone believes that this is the first attempt to dictate administrative rules of price regulation to producers, and more will follow. This initiative follows the same pattern, as far as I can tell. Once again, we are witnessing an attempt to use administrative leverage to regulate prices. Nothing good can come out of this for gas or oil markets. Overall, sometimes our colleagues and partners really surprise me by how unprofessional they are.

That is, it is produced in those countries, but consumed in Europe and in the United States. I believe that what they are trying to do now is a remnant of colonialism.

But the world has changed and they are unlikely to be able to do it today. Thank you. There is nothing out of the ordinary here. I will celebrate this New Year with my family, with people who are dear to me, and I will watch the President's speech, the address. As for sports, I do continue to exercise. I believe that this is just a way to stay in shape, and I must stay fit for work. It is like a pill that makes you feel good and work well. I wish everyone had this attitude to sports: it is a good thing. They say that it also helps stay fit mentally: a sound mind in a sound body. Thank you, too.  Have wonderful holidays!

Chief executives of enterprises from across Russia, from the Far East, Siberia, and the Urals, all the way to European Russia, have gathered here. The Governor and I have just toured the Instrument Design Bureau that is engaged in the development of high-precision and other weapons, including armoured vehicles. We will now discuss the issues of concern that we have been dealing with closely over the past several months. The main, key goal for defence industry enterprises is to provide our units, our advanced force, with everything they need – weapons, equipment, ammunition and gear. And, they must have the amount and numbers they need with the proper quality in a short amount of time. In addition, we must improve and substantially upgrade the performance of weapons and equipment with due account for the combat experience we have gained.  Today, I expect you to report on these things after our previous meetings. We met separately and then together, as you know. I would like to hear your proposals on resolving the problems – they are bound to exist in such extensive, large-scale work. I would also ask you to offer proposals on how we can move forward and what we will be doing to reduce the number of problems as much as possible.  A separate, crucial issue is feedback for defence industry enterprises from units engaged in the special military operation. I know, I talked about this recently – probably yesterday – that your specialists, engineers from many plants, are going right to the frontlines to quickly repair damaged equipment and put it back on the line. They check on how it is working and performing while the engineers make the changes in production to improve the performance, as we saw today at the company we visited. I will emphasise that this information exchange for upgrading the quality of military equipment in the special military operation must be permanent and very efficient. We began doing this a while back, in part when we used our weapons against the terrorist groups in Syria. I know that your employees, colleagues also went to Syria. They made decisions on the spot. They did a good job and continue doing a good job now.  Of course, I hope that the assignments in the state defence order on production and supplies of arms and military and other special equipment will be fulfilled in full in 2023, as was the case this year and in previous years. In conclusion, I would like to thank the directors and teams of defence industry enterprises for their conscientious work and real contribution to strengthening Russia’s defence capability and security, and I wish you success for the benefit of the Motherland and our people. And, of course, I would like to use this opportunity to once again wish you a happy upcoming New Year holiday.

This is a good result. But there is something we began to discuss yesterday, and the three of us had a talk: of course, the main issue is the settlement in the South Caucasus, and specifically, in Armenian-Azerbaijani relations, the tensions around Karabakh. So, as agreed, we will discuss all these matters at length. Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan     Pashinyan NikolPrime Minister of the Republic of Armenia : Thank you, Mr Putin. First of all, let me thank you for the invitation, and for organising the informal CIS summit. This is becoming a good CIS tradition. You are certainly right that our top and most urgent priority at the moment is the Lachin Corridor crisis. You know that the Lachin Corridor has remained blocked for almost 20 days. This is the area of responsibility of the Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh.

First of all, let me thank you for the invitation, and for organising the informal CIS summit. This is becoming a good CIS tradition.

I am delighted to see and greet you. We are creating a very good tradition – to hold a videoconference at the end of the year to review our work and map out plans to build up Russia-China relations and strategic partnership and to exchange views on the most topical international issues. But first of all, I would like to congratulate you and all our Chinese friends on the successful completion of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and you personally on being re-elected as General Secretary of the of CPC Central Committee. Your guiding role and the CPC’s leadership are essential for the sustainable socioeconomic development of the country and the strengthening of its positions on the global stage. I wholeheartedly wish every success to you and the friendly people of China. In the context of growing geopolitical tensions, the importance of the Russian-Chinese strategic partnership as a stability factor is growing. Our relations have passed all the tests, demonstrating their maturity and stability, and they continue to grow dynamically. As both of us pointed out, our current relations are enjoying the best period in their history and can be regarded as a model of cooperation between major powers in the 21st century. We maintained regular dialogue throughout the year. We held substantial discussions during the Olympic Games in Beijing and on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Samarkand, and we also had many telephone conversations. Active contacts are also maintained at other levels. Two major events were held during the past month alone: the 27th regular meeting of our heads of government and Chair of the United Russia party Dmitry Medvedev’s visit to Beijing. It was the first meeting of the leaders of our counties’ ruling parties after the CPC congress. Mr Medvedev told me about the warm welcome he received and the meaningful conversation he had with you. Intensive bilateral exchanges will continue in the coming year. I have no doubt that we will find an opportunity to meet in person. Mr President, my friend, we are expecting you next spring with a state visit to Moscow. This will demonstrate to the whole world how strong the Russian-Chinese friendship is, our agreement on key issues. Your visit will become the main political event of the year in bilateral relations. Despite the unfavourable external situation, the illegitimate restrictions and patent blackmail on the part of certain Western countries, Russia and China have achieved record high growth rates in mutual trade. In 2022, it increased by about 25 percent. If this trend continues, we will be able to achieve the target of $200 billion set by 2024 ahead of schedule. Energy supplies have reached unprecedented levels, and joint projects are underway to add capacity in hydrocarbons production and refining. In 2022, Russia became one of the leaders in oil exports to China. Also, Russia holds second place in terms of pipeline gas supplies to China, and fourth in terms of LNG exports. By December 1, Russia supplied to China 13.8 billion cubic metres of gas along the eastern route, and in December, supplies exceeded daily contractual targets by 18 percent. Next year, we will increase supplies even more. We note a significant increase in trade in agricultural produce. In January-November, we recorded a 36 percent increase, to $6 billion. We have implemented landmark projects involving transport infrastructure. For the first time in the history of our relations, permanent bridges have been built across the Amur River: the Blagoveshchensk-Heihe automobile bridge was opened on June 10, and the Nizhneleninskoye-Tongjiang railway bridge on November 16. Humanitarian exchanges are being restored. The third Russian-Chinese Winter Youth Games ended in Changchun a few days ago. This is a central event of the ongoing thematic Years of Cooperation in Fitness and Sports between Russia and China. The Games were organised at the highest level, once again reaffirming that sport is a shared property, and international competitions should bring people together, give them joy and a sense of unity, and not be used for momentary political purposes. Of course, defence and military technology cooperation, which contributes to ensuring the security of our countries and maintaining stability in key regions, has a special place in the entire range of Russian-Chinese cooperation and our relations. We aim to strengthen cooperation between the armed forces of Russia and China. Moscow and Beijing’s coordination on the international arena, including at the UN Security Council, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, BRICS, and the G20, serves to create a fair world order based on international law. We share the same views on the causes, course and logic of the ongoing transformation of the global geopolitical landscape. In the face of unprecedented pressure and provocations from the West, we defend our principled positions and protect not only our own interests, but also the interests of all those who stand for a truly democratic world order and the right of countries to freely determine their destiny. Mr President, I would like to wish you and all our Chinese friends a Happy New Year 2023 and the Chinese New Year, or the Spring Festival. I want to wish you happiness and health, and peace and prosperity to the friendly Chinese nation. Thank you. President of China Xi Jinping     Xi JinpingPresident of People's Republic of China  (retranslated): President Putin, my dear friend.  I am delighted to see you again.  A videoconference with you ahead of New Year’s Eve has become our good tradition. This year, we had two in-person meetings and spoke over the phone multiple times. We maintain close strategic contacts.  After the success of the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, you immediately sent me warm greetings. It was greatly appreciated.  Under our joint leadership, the overarching Russia-China partnership and strategic cooperation demonstrates maturity and ability to withstand challenges in this new age.  The inner potential and special values of this bilateral cooperation are becoming more apparent. Between January and November 2022, Russian-Chinese trade exceeded $170 billion, which is more than the annual turnover in 2021.  We are optimising and integrating our investment cooperation. Energy cooperation is the cornerstone of our relations. We consistently make progress in a number of joint projects that concern priority areas, boosting region-to-region cooperation. We are deepening cultural and humanitarian exchanges, promoting the events that are part of the programme of the Russian-Chinese years of physical fitness and sports. We are strengthening the public foundations of our friendship. I am satisfied with these results.  In the face of the challenging and largely ambivalent international situation, we are ready to build up strategic cooperation with Russia, providing each other with development opportunities and remaining global partners for the benefit of our countries and in the interests of stability in the entire world.

I am delighted to see and greet you. We are creating a very good tradition – to hold a videoconference at the end of the year to review our work and map out plans to build up Russia-China relations and strategic partnership and to exchange views on the most topical international issues. But first of all, I would like to congratulate you and all our Chinese friends on the successful completion of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and you personally on being re-elected as General Secretary of the of CPC Central Committee. Your guiding role and the CPC’s leadership are essential for the sustainable socioeconomic development of the country and the strengthening of its positions on the global stage. I wholeheartedly wish every success to you and the friendly people of China. In the context of growing geopolitical tensions, the importance of the Russian-Chinese strategic partnership as a stability factor is growing. Our relations have passed all the tests, demonstrating their maturity and stability, and they continue to grow dynamically. As both of us pointed out, our current relations are enjoying the best period in their history and can be regarded as a model of cooperation between major powers in the 21st century. We maintained regular dialogue throughout the year. We held substantial discussions during the Olympic Games in Beijing and on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Samarkand, and we also had many telephone conversations. Active contacts are also maintained at other levels. Two major events were held during the past month alone: the 27th regular meeting of our heads of government and Chair of the United Russia party Dmitry Medvedev’s visit to Beijing. It was the first meeting of the leaders of our counties’ ruling parties after the CPC congress. Mr Medvedev told me about the warm welcome he received and the meaningful conversation he had with you. Intensive bilateral exchanges will continue in the coming year. I have no doubt that we will find an opportunity to meet in person. Mr President, my friend, we are expecting you next spring with a state visit to Moscow. This will demonstrate to the whole world how strong the Russian-Chinese friendship is, our agreement on key issues. Your visit will become the main political event of the year in bilateral relations. Despite the unfavourable external situation, the illegitimate restrictions and patent blackmail on the part of certain Western countries, Russia and China have achieved record high growth rates in mutual trade. In 2022, it increased by about 25 percent. If this trend continues, we will be able to achieve the target of $200 billion set by 2024 ahead of schedule. Energy supplies have reached unprecedented levels, and joint projects are underway to add capacity in hydrocarbons production and refining. In 2022, Russia became one of the leaders in oil exports to China. Also, Russia holds second place in terms of pipeline gas supplies to China, and fourth in terms of LNG exports. By December 1, Russia supplied to China 13.8 billion cubic metres of gas along the eastern route, and in December, supplies exceeded daily contractual targets by 18 percent. Next year, we will increase supplies even more. We note a significant increase in trade in agricultural produce. In January-November, we recorded a 36 percent increase, to $6 billion. We have implemented landmark projects involving transport infrastructure. For the first time in the history of our relations, permanent bridges have been built across the Amur River: the Blagoveshchensk-Heihe automobile bridge was opened on June 10, and the Nizhneleninskoye-Tongjiang railway bridge on November 16. Humanitarian exchanges are being restored. The third Russian-Chinese Winter Youth Games ended in Changchun a few days ago. This is a central event of the ongoing thematic Years of Cooperation in Fitness and Sports between Russia and China. The Games were organised at the highest level, once again reaffirming that sport is a shared property, and international competitions should bring people together, give them joy and a sense of unity, and not be used for momentary political purposes. Of course, defence and military technology cooperation, which contributes to ensuring the security of our countries and maintaining stability in key regions, has a special place in the entire range of Russian-Chinese cooperation and our relations. We aim to strengthen cooperation between the armed forces of Russia and China. Moscow and Beijing’s coordination on the international arena, including at the UN Security Council, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, BRICS, and the G20, serves to create a fair world order based on international law. We share the same views on the causes, course and logic of the ongoing transformation of the global geopolitical landscape. In the face of unprecedented pressure and provocations from the West, we defend our principled positions and protect not only our own interests, but also the interests of all those who stand for a truly democratic world order and the right of countries to freely determine their destiny. Mr President, I would like to wish you and all our Chinese friends a Happy New Year 2023 and the Chinese New Year, or the Spring Festival. I want to wish you happiness and health, and peace and prosperity to the friendly Chinese nation. Thank you.

It was a year of difficult but necessary decisions, of important steps towards Russia's full sovereignty and a powerful consolidation of our society.  It was a year that put many things in their place, and drew a clear line between courage and heroism, on the one hand, and betrayal and cowardice on the other, showed us that there is nothing stronger than love for our near and dear, loyalty to our friends and comrades-in-arms, and devotion to our Fatherland. It was a year of truly pivotal, even fateful events. They became the frontier where we lay the foundation for our common future, our true independence.  This is what we are fighting for today, protecting our people in our historical territories in the new regions of the Russian Federation. Together, we are building and creating.  Russia’s future is what matters the most. Defending our Motherland is the sacred duty we owe to our ancestors and descendants. The moral and historical truth is on our side.  The outgoing year has brought great and dramatic changes to our country and to the world. It was filled with uncertainty, anxiety and worry.  But our multiethnic nation showed great courage and dignity as it had in every challenging period in Russian history, supported the defenders of our Fatherland, our soldiers and officers, and all participants in the special military operation, in both word and deed. We have always known that Russia's sovereign, independent and secure future depends only on us, on our strength and determination, and today, we have become convinced of it once again.  For years, Western elites hypocritically assured us of their peaceful intentions, including to help resolve the serious conflict in Donbass. But in fact, they encouraged the neo-Nazis in every possible way, who continued to take military and overtly terrorist action against peaceful civilians in the people's republics of Donbass. The West lied to us about peace while preparing for aggression, and today, they no longer hesitate to openly admit it and to cynically use Ukraine and its people as a means to weaken and divide Russia. We have never allowed anyone to do this and we will not allow it now.  Russian servicemen, militiamen and volunteers are now fighting for their homeland, for truth and justice, for reliable guarantees of peace and Russia’s security. They are all our heroes and they are shouldering the heaviest burden right now.  From the bottom of my heart, I wish a very happy New Year to every participant in the special military operation, to those who are here next to me now, and who are on the frontline, those getting ready for action at training centres, those who are in hospitals or already back home, having fulfilled their duty, to all those now on combat duty in strategic units, and all personnel of the Russian Armed Forces. Comrades,  thank you for your valiant service. Our entire vast country is proud of your fortitude, endurance and courage. Millions of people are with you in their hearts and souls, and will be raising a toast to you at their New Year's table.  Many thanks to everyone who provides ancillary support for military operations: drivers and railway workers who deliver supplies to the front, doctors, paramedics, and nurses who are fighting for soldiers’ lives and nursing wounded civilians. I thank the workers and engineers at our military and other plants who are working today with great dedication, builders who are erecting civilian facilities and defensive fortifications, and helping to restore the destroyed cities and villages in Donbass and Novorossiya.  Friends, Russia has been living under sanctions since the events in Crimea in 2014, but this year, a full-blown sanctions war has been unleashed against us. Those who started it expected our industry, finances and transport to collapse and never recover.  This did not happen, because together we created a reliable margin of safety. We have been taking steps and measures towards strengthening our sovereignty in a vitally important field, in the economy. Our struggle for our country, for our interests and for our future undoubtedly serves as an inspiring example for other states in their quest for a just multipolar world order.  I consider it very important that in the outgoing year, such qualities as mercy, solidarity and proactive empathy have become especially important in Russia. More and more Russians feel the need to help others. They rally together and take initiative without any formal instructions.  I want to thank you for being so considerate, responsible and kind, for your active involvement in the common cause regardless of age or income. You arrange warehouses and transport to deliver parcels to our fighters in the combat zone, to the residents of affected cities and towns, and help organise holidays for children from the new constituent entities of the Federation.  My friends, you are providing great support to the families of the fighters who perished, who gave their lives defending the lives of others.  I know how difficult it is for their wives, sons and daughters, and for their parents, who raised real heroes; I understand how they feel now, on New Year's Eve. We will make every effort to help the families of our fallen comrades raise their children, give them a good education, and get a profession.  With all my heart, I share your pain and ask you to accept my sincere words of support. Friends, Our country has always celebrated the start of the New Year, even during very difficult times. It has always been everyone’s favourite holiday, and has a magical power to reveal the best in people, to heighten the importance of traditional family values, the energy of kindness, generosity and trust.  As we see the New Year in, everyone strives to give joy to their loved ones, to show them attention and warmth, to give them presents they have been dreaming of, to see the delight in children’s eyes and parents’ touching gratitude for our attention. The older generation knows how to appreciate such moments of happiness.  Friends, now is the best moment to leave all personal grievances and misunderstandings in the past, to tell our nearest and dearest how we feel, how much we love them, how important it is to take care of each other – always, at any time.  Let these heartfelt words and noble feelings give each of us immense strength and confidence that together, we will overcome all the challenges and keep our country great and independent.  We will only move forward, to fight for our families and for Russia, for the future of our only, beloved Motherland.  Happy New Year, friends!

From the bottom of my heart, I wish a very happy New Year to every participant in the special military operation, to those who are here next to me now, and who are on the frontline, those getting ready for action at training centres, those who are in hospitals or already back home, having fulfilled their duty, to all those now on combat duty in strategic units, and all personnel of the Russian Armed Forces. Comrades,  thank you for your valiant service. Our entire vast country is proud of your fortitude, endurance and courage. Millions of people are with you in their hearts and souls, and will be raising a toast to you at their New Year's table.  Many thanks to everyone who provides ancillary support for military operations: drivers and railway workers who deliver supplies to the front, doctors, paramedics, and nurses who are fighting for soldiers’ lives and nursing wounded civilians. I thank the workers and engineers at our military and other plants who are working today with great dedication, builders who are erecting civilian facilities and defensive fortifications, and helping to restore the destroyed cities and villages in Donbass and Novorossiya.  Friends, Russia has been living under sanctions since the events in Crimea in 2014, but this year, a full-blown sanctions war has been unleashed against us. Those who started it expected our industry, finances and transport to collapse and never recover.  This did not happen, because together we created a reliable margin of safety. We have been taking steps and measures towards strengthening our sovereignty in a vitally important field, in the economy. Our struggle for our country, for our interests and for our future undoubtedly serves as an inspiring example for other states in their quest for a just multipolar world order.  I consider it very important that in the outgoing year, such qualities as mercy, solidarity and proactive empathy have become especially important in Russia. More and more Russians feel the need to help others. They rally together and take initiative without any formal instructions.  I want to thank you for being so considerate, responsible and kind, for your active involvement in the common cause regardless of age or income. You arrange warehouses and transport to deliver parcels to our fighters in the combat zone, to the residents of affected cities and towns, and help organise holidays for children from the new constituent entities of the Federation.  My friends, you are providing great support to the families of the fighters who perished, who gave their lives defending the lives of others.  I know how difficult it is for their wives, sons and daughters, and for their parents, who raised real heroes; I understand how they feel now, on New Year's Eve. We will make every effort to help the families of our fallen comrades raise their children, give them a good education, and get a profession.  With all my heart, I share your pain and ask you to accept my sincere words of support. Friends, Our country has always celebrated the start of the New Year, even during very difficult times. It has always been everyone’s favourite holiday, and has a magical power to reveal the best in people, to heighten the importance of traditional family values, the energy of kindness, generosity and trust.  As we see the New Year in, everyone strives to give joy to their loved ones, to show them attention and warmth, to give them presents they have been dreaming of, to see the delight in children’s eyes and parents’ touching gratitude for our attention. The older generation knows how to appreciate such moments of happiness.  Friends, now is the best moment to leave all personal grievances and misunderstandings in the past, to tell our nearest and dearest how we feel, how much we love them, how important it is to take care of each other – always, at any time.  Let these heartfelt words and noble feelings give each of us immense strength and confidence that together, we will overcome all the challenges and keep our country great and independent.  We will only move forward, to fight for our families and for Russia, for the future of our only, beloved Motherland.  Happy New Year, friends!

We have an entire programme dealing with this matter. Please tell me about the progress and, most importantly, about the production of equipment for civilian purposes.  Minister of Science and Higher Education Valery Falkov     Falkov ValeryMinister of Science and Higher Education : Of course, Mr President. You gave us the respective instructions, and as I promised, I would like to report on our progress today. This programme has been launched, with both the managerial and constructive issues resolved. As for the management, we have designated a specific federal project and have obtained all approvals. This is a project that belongs not only to the Ministry of Economic Development but also to the Finance Ministry and, of course, the Ministry of Industry and Trade. We have formed all the management bodies, determined ten key areas of focus and allocated 12 billion for the next three years.  And this is just the beginning because it is obvious that the programme requires more serious financing, which we will try to provide in the next few years. But right off the top, we chose four major universities: the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Bauman Moscow State Technical University and the National Research University of Electronic Technology. We also identified 15 priority positions and allocated almost 1 billion rubles. This work is underway.  I have met with Mr Manturov several times, specifically to discuss this matter. After all, we are not building a museum of prototypes but creating equipment for mainstream use.  Next, Mr President, as you instructed, we are not only working on research equipment but also on devices for study and laboratory work, to be used by Russian universities focusing on physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics. Perhaps math to a lesser extent but physics, chemistry and biology by all means. And, of course, chemical reagents because without these, lab equipment… Vladimir Putin: What do you think about the progress? Valery Falkov: We are off to a good start. Management is fully formed. We have ten major areas of work identified. We have organisations to work with and understand what needs to be done. I believe we will pick up momentum, and this year, we will be able to expand the list of available devices. Of course, it is important to constantly touch base with the scientific community, so to speak, and we do that. I will report to you on a regular basis.  Vladimir Putin: Alright. What else would you like to say? Valery Falkov: Just a few words. First of all, thank you for announcing the Decade of Science and Technology. You set very specific goals, one of which is to attract young talent to research and development. I would like to tell you briefly about two quite helpful, in my opinion, instruments of government support for youth.  First is the mega-grant programme, as you know, since you were the one who initiated it. I would like to report that the ninth competition for mega-grants was held in 2022, for which 293 applications were received. What got our attention? That, after all, the demand for this competition once again reaffirmed our openness to scientific cooperation: 293 applications from 44 countries. Finally, we selected 30 winners from 18 countries. And I can say that we did a serious job, everyone was asked: “Are you prepared, despite the possible logistical difficulties here?” Everyone expressed their readiness. Today we are creating similar laboratories and programmes in 13 regions. Second, Mr President, I have reported to you that we have a goal to create 900 laboratories until 2024. We have already created 500, as you defined, recommended, and instructed us to take a closer look. So we expedited this effort and created 240 last year. Moreover, we set them up based on the priorities that you identified, like the most important innovation projects. Suppose we have a new medicine – remember, as you pointed out in your Address – we created 35 laboratories for new medicines. Today, microelectronics is extremely relevant. Vladimir Putin: Where is it? Valery Falkov: In scientific and education institutes. Vladimir Putin: In fact, in wide-ranging locations. Valery Falkov: Yes, across the country; all federal districts were covered. Most of them were created in the Siberian Federal District. Each laboratory costs about 17 million rubles, 10 rates, and they are an excellent tool for attracting young people to science. Today we have 740 laboratories. Every laboratory means at least 10 jobs for young people, but also an opportunity to express themselves. And, if I may, I would also like to tell you about one new program. In line with your instructions, we and the Ministry of Education have implemented a project called University Sessions for schoolchildren from the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, and the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. There were about 14,000 young people in total, of which 10,611 people and 840 mentors went to various regions. This includes 42 universities from 27 regions. Personally, I visited one at Bauman Moscow State Technical University, went there to meet with the young people. It is both an education and a leisure programme; but it also has a sports module, there is a tour module, because we visited all our cities, saw the universities and decided, among other things, on the future. Vladimir Putin: There you can really select children who are enthusiastic, can’t you? Vladimir Falkov: Of course. The first and most important thing is to discover the genius in every child, in every person. And the second thing is the bright eyes; sometimes they might not have a lot of knowledge, but if their eyes are bright with interest, then the results can exceed expectations. Vladimir Putin: You created six modules? Vladimir Falkov: Yes, we have completed six modules. It seems to me a good experience and career guidance, and education, and a way to see our great country.  <…>', 'kremlin_id': 70319, 'place': '', 'title': 'Meeting with Minister of Science and Higher Education Valery Falkov', 'teaser': 'Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with Minister of Science and Higher Education Valery Falkov.

We are now communicating primarily with the military, but here and now, as they say, I want to first thank the specialists of the military-industrial complex who have developed and begun to mass-produce this unique weapon. As I said, it has no analogue in any country in the world. I know that such powerful weapons will make it possible to reliably defend Russia from potential external threats and will help ensure our national interests. I would like to stress that we will continue to build up the combat potential of the Armed Forces and produce advanced weapons and equipment that will guard Russia's security in the coming decades. This is a promising weapon. I would like to wish the ship’s crew success in their service for the good of the Fatherland. I would like to ask the Minister of Defence to report on the readiness of the ship to carry out the assigned tasks. Sergei Shoigu: Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, Today, the frigate Admiral of the Soviet Fleet Gorshkov, with Zircon hypersonic missiles on board, is embarking on a long-distance naval mission across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. The frigate Admiral of the Soviet Fleet Gorshkov is a modern multi-purpose ship with guided missile weapons designed to resolve challenges in the far seas and ocean zones. This vessel, armed with Zircon missiles, is capable of inflicting pinpoint and powerful strikes against an enemy at sea and on land. At the same time, one feature of the Zircon hypersonic missiles is the ability to reliably overcome today’s advanced air defence and missile defence systems. The missile’s flight speed exceeds Mach 9, and the range is over 1,000 kilometres. The main objectives during this mission will be focused on countering any threats to Russia, maintaining regional peace and stability together with friendly countries. During the exercises and training, the crew will practice the use of hypersonic weapons and long-range cruise missiles in various environmental conditions. Commander of the ship, please report on you readiness for the mission. Commander of the frigate Admiral of the Soviet Fleet Gorshkov Igor Krokhmal: Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, The commander of the frigate Admiral of the Soviet Fleet Gorshkov, Captain 1st Rank Igor Krokhmal is reporting. The ship went through the full cycle of preparations for its mission. It was equipped with ammunition for the missiles in the Zircon and Caliber systems, air defence systems, torpedo weapons, and artillery. The crew of the ship is ready to carry out the tasks of combat duty. Vladimir Putin: I am glad. Congratulations. This is a very large team effort that led to excellent and expected result.

Promsvyazbank CEO Pyotr Fradkov     Fradkov PyotrPromsvyazbank CEO : Good afternoon. Vladimir Putin: Mr Fradkov, I can see in the first presentation slide that the bank has both maintained its profitability and increased financing activities in the current environment. Pyotr Fradkov: This is indeed correct, Mr President. The bank is actively expanding its operations. In 2022, we became one of the five largest credit institutions in our country, with assets reaching almost five trillion rubles. Vladimir Putin: These are very good results if we look overall at the period of the bank’s existence in its new capacity. Pyotr Fradkov: This is significant growth; I would say the bank has shown more than a threefold rise in the past few years. And this comes with great responsibility as we are well aware that we must remain a major financial partner for the defence industry sector as well as for civilian industries, which is our main task. As regards the defence industry, most of these loans are offered at preferential interest rates, because when the bank was just being established in a new capacity, our major focus back then was on tackling the sanctions risks and granting preferential loans. I am talking about the advanced financing scheme for the state defence order, which we are implementing jointly with the Defence Ministry and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, as per your instructions. This loan scheme has proven very efficient. On the one hand, it allows for cheap financing without additional subsidies from the budget; these are the conditions that the bank offers. On the other hand, this means long-term financing. All the advantages are obvious to state customers – the Defence Ministry and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and now Roscosmos as well – to receive products in advance, while defence enterprises will be provided with finances on a regular basis, without any cash flow gaps. And this essentially allows the existing production facilities to implement regular orders and solve current tasks. We are actively making progress in this regard. Yet, as you have noted correctly, the civilian aspect is important for us as well in terms of our growth, and we are keeping up here too. This includes small and medium-sized businesses, for example. In 2022, we allocated a total of 850 billion rubles to support small and medium-sized businesses; this includes retail lending and mortgages. We are a leader in providing mortgage loans, including mortgages for military personnel. At least 60,000 military families have received such assistance from Promsvyazbank at preferential interest rates of no more than 8 percent. As to large civilian businesses, we are also a leader in lease financing for Russian-made aircraft, such as airplanes and helicopters. This is important work. Mr President, I would also like to report on the implementation of your instructions regarding our operations in Crimea. We started working and opened bank branches in all major cities of the Republic of Crimea. We opened a branch in Sevastopol, where an IT development centre has been set up as well. Many young specialists go there to work in this sector. By 2024, the bank will provide at least 225 billion rubles for programmes implemented in Crimea, bringing the amount of loans provided to local businesses in line with national levels and allowing economic operators of the peninsula, the city of Sevastopol and the Republic of Crimea, to enjoy equal advantages as regards access to financial resources. Another enormous, essential task for us is working in the new territories. We launched these efforts back in May, and we are continuing them in what are now new constituent entities of the Russian Federation. More than 1,200 people have been employed already, including local citizens. We consider it a major, important task. The banking infrastructure in place is very convenient now for providing social security and other benefits, payments and pensions, as well as for citizens to make payments for public utility and mobile service and receiving money transfers from other Russian regions. All this is already available. We will continue this work, including the effort we have already launched to provide loans to both large enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses. We see it as growing economic activity; this is becoming a major area of our operations.  Vladimir Putin: That is very good.

Minister of Education Sergei Kravtsov     Kravtsov SergeiMinister of Education : Mr President, let us begin with infrastructure. All the tasks that you have set for the Ministry are being fulfilled. We have a large programme underway to build schools. About 700 schools have already been built, or, if we consider all programmes, 900 schools. There is no such thing anywhere in the world. Many schools have swimming pools and up-to-date cafeterias. We also train teachers and prepare all education literature right away. The next area is kindergartens. Here, on the whole, the problem of availability of kindergartens has been solved: today we are at 99 percent, while a few years ago it was 80 percent. The most important school renovation programme was initiated by you. We approached it in such a way that some of the funds available in the regions could be left for major repairs. I would like to report that the Valentina Tereshkova School [in Yaroslavl], which was built 85 years ago, was also renovated. Today, it is an up-to-date space-themed school. Ms Tereshkova was involved personally in designing it. On September 1, the school opened its doors. It is fully equipped with modern facilities. Vladimir Putin: Now it looks completely different. Sergei Kravtsov: An absolutely new school, in fact. We focus a lot on rural schools. More than 70 percent of all schools under the capital renovation programme are rural schools. Equipment is also being purchased. Schoolchildren and parents also participate in designing them. A separate area is equipping schools with up-to-date facilities, as you mentioned. We have created more than 300 Quantoriums, and 13,000 Growth Points. These are advanced centres providing additional education in engineering, where children can study physics, biology, and chemistry, in depth after school. They are in great demand and very popular. A separate aspect deals with the development of secondary vocational education. Today, virtually 65 percent of school students enrol at colleges after graduating from the ninth grade. We have established over 3,000 modern workshops. We are actively implementing the Professional Training programme, when the industry also invests heavily in colleges. We have received an additional one billion rubles from enterprises.  The creation of a special centre for training shop-floor instructors is an important aspect of the Professional Training programme. This previously non-existent concept is highly popular. We will train shop-floor instructors for the secondary vocational education system. In 2024, we will start operating the centre at full capacity. Support for teacher training universities is a separate aspect. You have supported this project. We are setting up technology parks and also supplying modern equipment, and we have also overhauled various facilities. We are now setting up about 3,000 pedagogical classes. These are good career guidance courses, and are therefore in high demand, all the more so as we are creating modern spaces. I would also like to mention pedagogical Quantorium technology parks, with the same modern equipment that we deliver to schools, so that graduates would be able to operate such equipment after finding employment at schools. Mr President, support for the new regions of the Russian Federation is a separate task. We have done the work necessary to open 1,337 schools on September 1. We have provided them with computer equipment and school books, and about 30,000 children have attended our camps for children. Together with the heads of these new regions we are now drafting a comprehensive programme to develop the education system, so that it would meet the Russian Federation’s standards. We will pay separate attention to sport infrastructure. We have met with children, and most of them (virtually everyone) are saying that they need gyms and sport infrastructure, which were lacking. We will certainly do this.  Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to present this book to you. We held a contest under the heading “What does it mean to be with Russia?” The book contains the many poems, drawings and essays that the children have sent us, and I would like to give this collection to you.

Head of the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service Maxim Shaskolsky     Shaskolsky MaximHead of the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service : Mr President, Applying price controls in the markets of socially significant goods is our priority. I am talking not only about food products, but also medicines, petroleum products, building materials and cellular communications services. Our food production market is well developed; it is a highly competitive market with a large number of participants. Therefore, in this area, the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service’s efforts include measures to help boost harvests and production volumes. For example, we are monitoring the process of allocating government subsidies to agricultural producers, and have issued about 35 warnings in recent time to the various bodies that are responsible for ensuring that agricultural producers have non-discriminatory access to such subsidies. In addition, work is underway to ensure that our agricultural producers have enough mineral fertiliser at affordable prices. To this end, we have worked together with our colleagues from the relevant ministries to develop a trade and marketing policy that incorporates the procedures for pricing fertilisers and indexing their prices, and the upper limits for distributors’ charges. These trade and marketing policies have been approved by major producers of mineral fertilisers; the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service takes steps to enforce compliance. As a result, our agricultural producers are fully provided with mineral fertilisers at affordable prices. Another instruction you gave us had to do with retail chain markups on socially significant food items. We have taken steps to ensure that the markups on socially significant food products in federal retail chains have gone down from 22 to 5.5 percent. Such responsible pricing was also supported by 79 regional retail chains. We have carried out additional work with regard to specific foods such as bread, milk, sugar, the so-called borsch basket, and federal retail chains have made commitments to maintain a margin of no more than 5 percent for the most popular goods in each category. Vladimir Putin: Good. What else would you like to discuss? Go ahead, please. Maxim Shaskolsky: As I said, we are also working on the pharmaceuticals market. We have a list of vital, essential medicines; we have revised the prices of 14,000 such medicines, of which 7,000 have been reduced by an average of 35 percent. In the building materials market, we found that the rise in prices was caused not only by market conditions, but also by certain businesses’ actions, which, among other things, focused on the so-called export alternative. We have conducted a number of investigations and filed lawsuits against certain metals companies, as well as makers of building materials from wood, aerated concrete, and glass. More investigations are ongoing. We can say that this is one of the reasons why the prices of a number of building materials are going down. Vladimir Putin: Good.

I would like to congratulate you again on this event and wish you success. Quite recently – a couple of days ago or so – we met with the Prime Minister and some colleagues from the Government to discuss the results and our plans for the new year. Mr Mishustin explained how the Government organises its work in major areas technology-wise, including the implementation of national projects. What would I like to say? We spoke about this during a restricted format meeting – but I would like to note this again. First, I would like to thank you for your work in 2022. Nothing that our opponent had predicted for us came true. This was done, of course, primarily by the citizens of Russia, their focus, our entire focus, our readiness to face challenges and work in difficult conditions. Much credit for this also goes to the Government. Mr Mishustin managed to put together an effective, modern team of interested people – people that are interested in the results of their work. He also organised the technology aspects of all these activities, which is certainly producing the expected results. We know (I just discussed this with our colleagues from the Executive Office this morning) that we have additional budget revenues, and they are not oil or gas revenues, but they are from non-commodity sectors: a preliminary 200 billion in additional revenues. This gives us the opportunity to meet every development objective we have and solve current tasks that are serious and important. I am referring to the tasks at the federal level and the regional dimension as well. Of course, we absolutely need to find a solution as soon as possible for ensuring sovereign development, that is, independent development despite any external pressure or threats. I would like to emphasise that we can reliably guarantee the country's security and interests; we will increase our defence capability and will certainly resolve all the issues related to supporting the Armed Forces, every unit involved in the special military operation. At the same time, we will continue to implement large socioeconomic programmes and plans aimed at improving people's well-being, unlocking Russia's enormous potential, and expanding our international ties. We certainly have all the resources we need for this. We have outlined the six key priorities for this year, and I would just like to reiterate a few points we discussed earlier. The first point is the expansion of Russia’s foreign economic relations and the development of new logistics corridors. As a matter of fact, we are working intensively towards this – we need to continue in the same vein. Next, we need to achieve noticeable positive results in improving roads, other infrastructure, housing and utilities, although 2022 was a successful and good year in this respect. Well, what else can I say? Deputy Prime Minister [Marat] Khusnullin and I just discussed the construction sector’s results the other day – good performance, one of the best in our history. As for housing construction, it is probably the best. We have taken the first steps and need to maintain this pace. Thirdly, we need to drastically enhance the technological capabilities of the Russian economy, to stimulate the creation of new facilities and jobs. Everybody is doing it, absolutely. First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov is working in the most promising areas, and I very much hope that together with the companies that have been designated as leading companies, we will continue the work that was started last year. The fourth point. Strengthening the financial sovereignty of our country is a systemic issue. This is vital for boosting investment in high-tech companies, industry, agriculture and many other sectors. I am very much counting on the effective work of the Central Bank and the Government here, primarily, the economic bloc and the Finance Ministry, as was the case in 2022. Fifth. It is necessary to develop economic policy measures in such a way that will lead to the growth of real wages and incomes, and, coupled with social support measures, primarily for families with children, will ensure the continued reduction of poverty and inequality. The sixth priority. Special attention must be paid to addressing acute demographic problems – much has been said about this, so I will not go into detail at this point. We understand what the main problems are in this area and how to resolve them. Of course, I am referring, in part, to addressing these issues by making modern, high-quality healthcare more accessible. I would like to emphasise that the work in this area must embrace all regions of the country, including Russia’s new regions. This is exactly why the task was set to ensure a systemic, comprehensive approach to integrating the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions into Russia’s common socioeconomic space. Let me recall that the Government has been instructed to draft a special development programme for the new regions before the end of the current quarter. By 2030, they should reach the national average in terms of infrastructure, social services and many other parameters of living standards. I would like to ask the Government, federal agencies and colleagues in the regions to work out, clearly and consistently, all the details of this programme. Of course, it is necessary to promptly address the most urgent, vital issues now. In fact, this is what we are doing. I understand that the situation in the new regions is complicated – hostilities continue in some areas, peaceful life has not been restored and security is not ensured in many of these regions. Naturally, it is necessary to consider all these factors, but this is not a reason to take a break and postpone the resolution of the most urgent issues. It is necessary to set specific goals now and work to achieve them gradually. This is exactly what people are waiting for – people that are really going through hard times and want to see changes for the better. It is essential to set clear and understandable development benchmarks for Russia’s new regions, so that people know what will be built in their cities and towns, which facilities will be renovated and when, how family incomes will grow, what kind of assistance they will receive from the state, how kindergartens, schools, universities, hospitals and clinics will operate, when enterprises will reopen, what kind of support small businesses and entrepreneurs will receive, and how infrastructure and transport will develop. Here I would like to emphasise the need to support local entrepreneurs. Of course, if we need investment from major Russian sources, from our large companies – private or state-owned – we need to facilitate that as well. But it is of the essence to support local businesses wherever possible. Key performance indicators for the development of the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, LPR and DPR must be established for this year, 2023. I am referring to uniform and transparent criteria for assessing not only regional and municipal, but also federal authorities, so that our colleagues at the local level join the federal Government, ministries and agencies, and direct their forces and resources towards priority areas that require attention in the first place. In addition – we have already talked about this, and I want to stress once again that – it is necessary to involve the new regions in the implementation of our national projects, and this, among other things, means that funding needs to be provided to back the activities under national projects in the territories of the DPR, LPR, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. We have discussed this many times, and I know that the Government is working hard on drafting key performance indicators for the development of the new regions and involving them in the national projects, but I would like to point this out again: this work is far from completed, and we need to resolve the outstanding issues as soon as possible. As for today's agenda, we agreed to focus on social support measures in the new regions – arranging the payment of all social benefits to the local population. Ms Golikova will report on this today. But before we begin, I would like to ask Mr Manturov to tell us how the instructions are being carried out to implement long-term programmes to upgrade the aircraft fleet and the water transport fleet. We worked on this a lot last year, and we all realise how critical these issues are, especially with regard to air transport. We discussed this just a month ago at the meeting of the Council for Strategic Development. Let's get to work. As I suggested, Mr Manturov will begin. Go ahead, please. Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov: Thank you very much. Mr President, colleagues, Following up on your instruction, we submitted a passport for an aircraft leasing investment project to the Government at the end of 2022. The decision to approve it was fully agreed upon. In 2023–2025, Aeroflot will receive 63 aircraft, including 34 Superjets under the import substitution project, 18 MC-21 and 11 Tu-214 aircraft. This year, 175 billion rubles will be set aside from the National Welfare Fund to fund this programme. In addition, separate passports will be approved this year under orders placed by other airlines to ensure the implementation of a comprehensive programme for developing the aviation industry. The aircraft industry is ready to fulfil the goal that you set. Given the strategic importance of the project, it was decided to finance it from the NWF at a preferential rate of 1.5 percent without excessive requirements concerning return on investment. The Ministry of Economic Development is drafting appropriate amendments to the regulatory framework and this work will be completed soon, after which the Finance Ministry will promptly make the funds available to the lessor via redemption of bonds. This is a Rostec subsidiary called Aviakapital-Servis, which will sign contracts with aircraft manufacturing companies. We propose implementing a similar approach under the programme for low-cost water transport leasing. We would like you, Mr President, to support the proposal for issuing loans from the National Welfare Fund at 1.5 percent per annum and easing the requirements concerning return on investment. We have already formed an investment project, and the STLC [State Transport Leasing Company] in conjunction with the Finance Ministry have agreed on its parameters in the usual course of business. Our shipyards plan to build 260 civilian vessels in 2023–2027 as part of this order which will include a wide range of equipment of varying deadweight that can be used for various purposes. Cargo ships, such as tankers, container ships, barges, tugs, and dry cargo ships, including Arctic class vessels, will account for the bulk of orders. Much remains to be done with regard to continued development of the passenger fleet, including electric vessels which will be put in operation in Moscow this year. The first two electric river boats that are part of a total order of 21 such boats placed by Moscow are undergoing trials. We are focusing separately on building fishing vessels and dredgers to be used for breaking water artery bottlenecks which is particularly important with more logistics routes coming into service. Overall, the programme for upgrading the civilian fleet has been drawn up for 231 billion rubles. In addition to ten billion rubles for subsidies, this programme provides for the allocation of 136 billion rubles from the NWF. The STLC will raise another 85 billion from the market. This combined model will produce an economically effective leasing model for the operators.  Today, the key task it to rapidly approve the investment project passport. We are ready to submit it to the Government and hope that my colleagues will quickly resolve procedural issues, which will allow us to start financing in this quarter as you, Mr President, have instructed us. Thank you for your attention. Vladimir Putin: Mr Manturov, have you received the paper that I forwarded to you? It was sent to me with the signatures of the St Petersburg Governor and the head of the company that makes Meteors, I think. It is quite a financially intensive project.  Denis Manturov: I can confirm that, Mr President. We consider St Petersburg one of the leaders in terms of upgrading marine passenger transport, so we are continuously working with our colleagues. They are actively using support measures, including for Meteors and electric vessels. In a similar fashion as Moscow is now buying them, similar work is underway for St Petersburg. And also for vessels running on natural gas motor fuel. So we are actively involved in all this. Vladimir Putin: Good. Financial instruments simply must be developed there. You have just mentioned them. It is necessary to provide them with a timely order.  Denis Manturov: We are using the current subsidy that traditionally has been used for many years, providing us with a discount rate, and the NWF funds that will reduce the effective rate for the consumers, including the regions. Vladimir Putin: Look here – as you have just said, 700 aircraft, including helicopters, and 260 civilian water vessels, such as ships, supply vessels and so on will be delivered by 2030.  It is necessary to discuss these 700 aircraft, including helicopters, with the Defence Ministry. It should be clear how many of them the military department will order and how many civilian vessels should be produced. Some companies have not yet received an order, even for 2023. Denis Manturov: As for the Defence Ministry, we reported to you in Tula the aircraft equipment figures; the planned production targets include the civilian order and take into account the production capacity of finishers and component suppliers, including, most importantly, engines. To boost that, we are implementing investment projects to resolve problems with aircraft engines, primarily for helicopters – the VK-2500 engines made by the Klimov plant in St Petersburg. We are cooperating with other enterprises, too, but it is essential to enhance the capacity at Klimov as a finisher, in order to fulfil the Defence Ministry’s order and those for civilian customers as well. We also keep in mind exports. Vladimir Putin: It is taking too long! Much too long. Companies need to know what their immediate plans and orders are going to be. They need to hire workers, they need to maintain or expand production capacity, do you understand that? They need to know how much the military department will order, and how many civilian aircraft will be ordered. But certain companies do not have contracts even for 2023. Denis Manturov: Actually, the Defence Ministry has confirmed this year’s figures for all enterprises. Moreover, as I have reported to you, Russian Helicopters enterprises have taken loans – we are primarily talking about helicopters – in order to sign contracts with their Tier Two, Three and Four suppliers. Therefore, we have all the plans drawn up for the current as well as the next year. Vladimir Putin: Mr Manturov, as long as there are no manufacturer's specifications (passports), as you mentioned yourself, and companies do not have those, just like they have no contracts, there is no understanding of what they will do or what they need to do. It is taking too long. Please, I ask you to speed up this process. Enterprises do not have contracts for 2023, what can I say to that? As you said, there are no manufacturer's specifications. When will they be ready? And there are no contracts yet. Denis Manturov: Here is the instruction, Mr President. We have the contracts, as I reported, from the Defence Ministry, from the civilian customers, the State Transport Leasing Company and other leasing companies – this is in terms of helicopters. And we have all the plans drawn up for aircraft. They take into account the technical trials, certification and import substitution programmes – the Superjet and MC-21. Everything has been fully drawn up. Vladimir Putin: Mr Manturov, you say everything is ready to go, but there are no contracts. This is what I am telling you. Let's discuss this after the meeting. There is no point in our splitting hairs at this point. I know no contracts have been signed with the enterprises, the directors told me so. What are you fooling around for? When will the contracts be signed? This is my point. Directors of enterprises are telling me there are no contracts while you are telling me that everything is ready to go. When will the passports be available? When will the contracts be signed? These are the questions I need answers to. Denis Manturov: With regard to the aircraft passport which I just reported on, the instruction was issued strictly in accordance with the task that you set. Other passports will be ready during this quarter based on the funds available under the budget, including under the preferential National Welfare Fund programme. Vladimir Putin: I want all of this to be done within a month. What quarter are you talking about? Do we not understand the circumstances we are in? Please complete this work within a month. Okay? Denis Manturov: We will try to do our best with our colleagues from the economic bloc. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: No, do not try to do your best; please get it done in a month. It must be done in a month, no later. Agreed? Denis Manturov: Yes. Vladimir Putin: Do you know why I mentioned this? I took note of some of the wording. You said, “We will do it soon.” What does “soon” mean? The timeframe must be clear and comprehensible. I am not pulling it out of thin air, am I? Directors of enterprises are telling me there are no contracts. Okay, we will get back to it with you later. We are talking every day as it is, and we will talk more today and tomorrow. Mr Savelyev, please update us on where we stand with removing containers from the Far East. We talked about this many times. I am aware that the situation has changed and cars and gondola cars are not going from the Far Eastern Russia to the European Russia empty now, but I would still like to hear your assessments. Please. Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev: Mr President, colleagues, To begin with, allow me to thank you for supporting the solutions proposed by the Ministry of Transport in November on removing containers from the seaports of the Far East. This really helped us stabilise the situation there. The main seaports of the Far East with container terminals are Vladivostok and Vostochny Port. There are also 17 rear container terminals there. The average daily removal of containers with imported goods by rail and road amounted to 3,713 TEU containers in December 2022. This is 8.8 percent more than the daily average for November and 18.7 percent more than the relevant figure for October 2022.  The practice of loading up gondola cars proved effective. As you have just noted, we managed to increase considerably container shipments in gondola cars. At the same time, we resolved the problem of empty cars travelling in the reverse direction after unloading coal at Far Eastern ports.  In November, we sent 43 container trains while in December this figure was already 121, that is about four trains a day. We plan to bring that number to five in February. To encourage such shipments, Russian Railways has extended a discounted rate for the shipment of containers in gondola cars for until the end of this year. In December, we set daily records for container removal by rail – 4,318 containers, including 1,088 containers in gondola cars. For instance, today we shipped 4,200 containers. In cooperation with the operator community and Russian Railways, we hope to bring the daily average removal of containers to 4,100–4,300 this year. (The Minister proceeded to speak about shipments in the first ten days of January 2023. As of January 11, sea terminals were at 97 percent of capacity and rear terminals were at 70 percent.  Vitaly Savelyev also noted that the modernisation of the railway infrastructure of the Eastern Operating Domain made it possible to substantially increase their carrying capacity in late 2022 to the planned figure of 158 million tonnes.) The measures we have already undertaken and plan to implement in the near future will allow us to increase the number of containers in 2023 by more than 60 percent over the figure for 2022. In effect, this compensates for transhipments made before in the north-western part of the country. We do not see any factors that would lead to a decline in demand for exports and imports via ports of the Far East. As you have noted more than once, all logistics have been reoriented to the east.  That is why, in conjunction with Russian Railways and the business community, we are working through additional options for increasing imports and exports based on expanded gondola car transport, the ongoing upgrades to the Eastern Operating Domain and increasing eastbound volumes shipped across border crossings. By mid-April, we will draft a set of measures to ensure daily shipments of 6,000 to 6,500 containers to the Far East. (Vitaly Savelyev also covered the work of the transport complex during New Year holidays. The transit needs of individuals and the national economy were met in full for all means of transport despite extreme weather such as snowfall, sub-zero temperatures and freezing rain. In particular, over 2.26 million passengers used air transport, up 11.3 percent from this time last year, and 17.6 million passengers used long-distance rail transport and commuter trains, or 10.7 percent more than last year.) Before and during the New Year holidays, children, including organised groups, were transported by all means of conveyance to children’s New Year parties and performances. In addition, a socially important project was implemented where over 2,000 children and accompanying persons from the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics and the Zaporozhye, Kherson and Belgorod regions travelled to attend children’s New Year's performances at the State Kremlin Palace. Mr President, the transport complex is ready to address any and all challenges in 2023 in order to ensure uninterrupted connectivity and to meet the transport needs of the national economy and passengers. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Mr Belozerov, do you have anything to add to what the Minister just said? Russian Railways CEO Oleg Belozerov: Mr President, we coordinated on the report. I might add just one figure. We ended 2022 with some unprecedented results. First of all, upon your instruction, 20 percent more passengers were transported to southern destinations. Also, we bought a record number of passenger cars, over 1,000. Mr Savelyev provided a general overview of the Eastern Operating Domain. Also, our numbers are up not only in terms of exports, but also in terms of our operations within the Eastern Domain where we transported over 8 percent more cargo for domestic consumption. This is a good number, which tells us that the economy in this macro-region is growing fast. We stand ready to complete any assignment. Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Mr Novak, please say a few words about your area – coal shipments and so on. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak: Mr President, in 2022 our coal production increased by 0.3 percent despite the embargo on coal supplies to Europe introduced on August 10. Nonetheless, overall coal production increased a bit, mostly owing to supplies to the domestic market. They went up by about 8 percent, and exports fell by 7 percent. In other words, owing to low water levels and reduced generation of electricity at hydropower plants, demands on coal stations grew, and this is why the domestic market went up. Moreover, the domestic market was provided with railway shipments, as my colleagues have just reported. We have no problems in this area, there is full synchronisation. The Far East is our main focus this year. We are using existing opportunities to expand the Baikal-Amur Railway, the eastern route in general. So we will continue resolving tasks set for the coal industry in cooperation with our colleagues. Vladimir Putin: Are our oil-and-gas companies coping with the problems that their competitors are trying to create for them, using political mechanisms and instruments? Alexander Novak: Yes, there are difficulties, of course. However, the overall volumes of exports and shipments we saw in December, starting December 5 when the embargo on shipments to Europe and a ceiling on maritime shipments were introduced, difficulties with insurance and services by sea-going transport… We are in constant contact with our companies. The contracting for February has been completed, and on the whole, companies are not reporting any contracting problems. Yes, sometimes, contractors demand that a price ceiling be considered in these contracts. However, when concluding contracts, in view of your Executive Order and requirements for companies, despite the fact that it takes effect on February 1, we set the companies the task for December and January and for contracting in February of not being too tough in establishing a price ceiling in contracts because it can pose a risk in the future. The price ceiling on oil products takes effect on February 5. The European Union has not yet established these prices. They are reviewing a relevant proposal, methodology and differentiation by type of oil products. As for oil, the main problem is a big discount due to high freight costs. In other words, the costs of freight have grown considerably because of the risks transport operators and contractors are facing due to potential sanctions for not establishing a price ceiling. I hope this is a temporary situation and the discount will drop with time as it happened in 2022 when it grew a lot in March and April but then started dropping gradually and finally was cut in half. So, I think today the discount is posing the biggest risk. The second risk is the embargo on supplies of oil products and the introduction of a price ceiling. We will respond to these challenges, we will report and take all necessary measures to supply new markets, including logistics and transportation. That concludes my report. Vladimir Putin: We must take a closer look at this discount so as not to create any problems with the budget. Do you understand what I am talking about? Discuss this issue and then report your proposals to me separately, please, all right?  Alexander Novak: All right. Understood. Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Mr Khusnullin, we discussed the performance of the construction sector several times. I would like you to tell our colleagues now some of the things we have talked about. Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin: Mr President, We did some good work last year, and we are a hundred percent sure that the completed housing projects will amount to 101.5 million square metres, as all the regions have confirmed. I believe that the figure will be even larger, according to the updates. It is the largest volume of housing we have built in history, including the Soviet period. Second, thanks to the systemic road construction measures you supported, we have formulated a five-year road construction programme and coordinated all our road building plans with the regions. To date, we have paved 170 million square metres of roads with asphalt. This is the second figure. As for the Eastern Operating Domain and the territory of the Far East, we complied with your instructions to compile five-year road building plans aimed at improving roads and bringing them to standard. (Marat Khusnullin also spoke about efforts to reduce the investment and construction cycle, the social project to connect households to the gas supply network, the improvement of the housing and utilities sector, the preparation of a programme for the Far Eastern Federal District and the new regions. The Deputy Prime Minister said this would boost industrial construction. He said that, despite the sanctions, last year’s results were record high for the past few years thanks to the work of the Government and large monopolies, as well as close ties with the regions. The increment in the construction sector will be at least 6 percent year-on-year, because the figure for the last 11 or 12 months was 8–9 percent.) Vladimir Putin: We are grateful to the construction sector for these record-high results. Incidentally, I would also like to thank those who were working in the new regions, helping the Defence Ministry to build the defence lines. Regrettably, there have been casualties among construction personnel. We must not forget this, and we must help their families. Construction workers have always been respected as creators, and now their profession has become a heroic vocation. I would like to thank you and all those who were tackling the tasks facing the country in this sphere. I congratulate them on their achievements, just as I congratulated our farmers who have achieved excellent results. I am not only referring to the record harvest, which does not happen by itself, but also to the work of the sector as a whole. It did really well, achieving very good results. I am referring to the agricultural and processing complex. We had the lowest unemployment rate as of the end of 2022. How much was it, 3.7 percent? Inflation was also below expectations. In this context, I would like to ask both the Economic Development Minister and the Finance Minister to comment on these results. Mr Reshetnikov, go ahead, please. Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov: Mr President, We have just received the latest data summing up the 2022 results. The rate of inflation was below 12 percent, totalling 11.9 percent, to be more precise, despite the fact that we brought forward the adjustment of utility rates for inflation from July 1, 2023, to December 1, 2022. This was largely attributable to the stabilised prices in the agricultural sector, which came on the heels of high crop yields, as well as the fact that we have been quite effective over the past years in working along the value chain and developing distribution. Agricultural products arrive quite quickly on store shelves, the environment is becoming increasingly competitive, which in turn improves pricing. With this in mind, we expect a substantial drop in inflation year-on-year by the end of the first quarter, so that in the second quarter the numbers we will probably see could even fall below our 4 percent target, at least at some point. Therefore, keeping inflation within this range and making sure that it stabilises in the second half of the year is probably our key goal for the year. This has already enabled us to plan all the processes with more confidence, and most importantly to deliver on the goal you have mentioned, which is to ensure higher real household incomes. Without resolving the inflation issue we will never deliver on this task. According to preliminary data, nominal wages have been demonstrating positive momentum across the economy, on the whole. This reflects the situation on the labour market and the fact that there is a certain deficit there, which is obviously due to the fact that defence manufacturing and the engineering sector have seen an increase in their workload. On the one hand, lower imports pose a challenge, while on the other hand this create more orders for our manufacturers, which in turn translates into additional demand for labour. All this pushes wages up. Of course, it is essential that manufacturers keep improving their efficiency and continue to invest. We have taken system-wide decisions last year in keeping with your instructions after a meeting with you, so the key issues were settled and this year we will carry out these decisions. Vladimir Putin: An increase in nominal wages is a good thing, but this is nothing more than statistics that we have to keep in mind. We need to ensure that households see an increase in their real incomes. This is obvious, and everyone understands this. Of course, we must factor the decelerating inflation into our overall economic policy. In fact, we all understand this. But I want the entire economic bloc to treat it this way, including the Finance Ministry. Mr Siluanov, now to you. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov: Mr President, last year’s budget policy focused not only on responding to the challenges we faced, but also on supporting households and businesses, on achieving our goals and implementing national projects, which are among our priorities. Last year showed that, despite all the restrictions we faced, we basically attained the objectives planned and fully provided the required financial resources for that. To do this, we increased total spending by more than 6 trillion rubles above the plan, so total spending amounted to 31.2 trillion rubles. We had never spent as much in history. We financed that spending using our additional income of about 2.8 trillion rubles; that was one resource. Another resource was our vigorous activity in the loans market. Together with banks, we raised additional resources worth about 3.5 trillion rubles. True, we have a slightly larger deficit than planned, at 2.3 percent of GDP. But if we exclude the money that went to state social security funds to compensate them for lost income as a result of the deferment that we provided for businesses (it seems appropriate to exclude this amount), then the deficit is 1.8 percent of GDP, which fits the target you defined as a benchmark for this year and the next. Importantly – as you mentioned the labour market – we have helped and provided measures to support the labour market allocating 28 billion rubles for this. But that was not the most important thing; the crucial thing was to help people. We raised pensions by 10 percent in June, which was an unscheduled indexation. We have also indexed the minimum wage and the subsistence minimum by the same amount allocating almost 500 billion rubles additionally for these purposes. We established new benefits for families with children. Last year, we allocated more than 400 billion rubles to support families with children aged 8 to 16. That was a novelty that we did not plan for last year, but we still adopted this measure to support the lowest-income families. The Unified Social Fund has been created. Businesses received support. In addition to the deferral programme, we subsidised interest on their loans, to ensure that capital continued to be available for the development of production. We helped enterprises, helped our builders – compensated them for the rise in construction costs. And so on and so forth – a lot has been done. We generally believe that the budget was an essential component influencing the dynamics of the overall GDP. We have made a major contribution – as a state customer – to the development of the economy and, most importantly, we supported Russians during this difficult period for the country. To be continued.\", 'kremlin_id': 70338, 'place': 'Novo-Ogaryovo, Moscow Region', 'title': 'Meeting with Government members', 'teaser': 'The President held a videoconference meeting with Government members.', 'tags': ['Construction industry', 'Economy and finance', 'Industry', 'Regions', 'Social services', 'Transport'], 'transcript_filtered': \"Good afternoon, colleagues, We are holding the first meeting with Government members in 2023. I would like to congratulate you again on this event and wish you success. Quite recently – a couple of days ago or so – we met with the Prime Minister and some colleagues from the Government to discuss the results and our plans for the new year. Mr Mishustin explained how the Government organises its work in major areas technology-wise, including the implementation of national projects. What would I like to say? We spoke about this during a restricted format meeting – but I would like to note this again. First, I would like to thank you for your work in 2022. Nothing that our opponent had predicted for us came true. This was done, of course, primarily by the citizens of Russia, their focus, our entire focus, our readiness to face challenges and work in difficult conditions. Much credit for this also goes to the Government. Mr Mishustin managed to put together an effective, modern team of interested people – people that are interested in the results of their work. He also organised the technology aspects of all these activities, which is certainly producing the expected results. We know (I just discussed this with our colleagues from the Executive Office this morning) that we have additional budget revenues, and they are not oil or gas revenues, but they are from non-commodity sectors: a preliminary 200 billion in additional revenues. This gives us the opportunity to meet every development objective we have and solve current tasks that are serious and important. I am referring to the tasks at the federal level and the regional dimension as well. Of course, we absolutely need to find a solution as soon as possible for ensuring sovereign development, that is, independent development despite any external pressure or threats. I would like to emphasise that we can reliably guarantee the country's security and interests; we will increase our defence capability and will certainly resolve all the issues related to supporting the Armed Forces, every unit involved in the special military operation. At the same time, we will continue to implement large socioeconomic programmes and plans aimed at improving people's well-being, unlocking Russia's enormous potential, and expanding our international ties. We certainly have all the resources we need for this. We have outlined the six key priorities for this year, and I would just like to reiterate a few points we discussed earlier. The first point is the expansion of Russia’s foreign economic relations and the development of new logistics corridors. As a matter of fact, we are working intensively towards this – we need to continue in the same vein. Next, we need to achieve noticeable positive results in improving roads, other infrastructure, housing and utilities, although 2022 was a successful and good year in this respect. Well, what else can I say? Deputy Prime Minister [Marat] Khusnullin and I just discussed the construction sector’s results the other day – good performance, one of the best in our history. As for housing construction, it is probably the best. We have taken the first steps and need to maintain this pace. Thirdly, we need to drastically enhance the technological capabilities of the Russian economy, to stimulate the creation of new facilities and jobs. Everybody is doing it, absolutely. First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov is working in the most promising areas, and I very much hope that together with the companies that have been designated as leading companies, we will continue the work that was started last year. The fourth point. Strengthening the financial sovereignty of our country is a systemic issue. This is vital for boosting investment in high-tech companies, industry, agriculture and many other sectors. I am very much counting on the effective work of the Central Bank and the Government here, primarily, the economic bloc and the Finance Ministry, as was the case in 2022. Fifth. It is necessary to develop economic policy measures in such a way that will lead to the growth of real wages and incomes, and, coupled with social support measures, primarily for families with children, will ensure the continued reduction of poverty and inequality. The sixth priority. Special attention must be paid to addressing acute demographic problems – much has been said about this, so I will not go into detail at this point. We understand what the main problems are in this area and how to resolve them. Of course, I am referring, in part, to addressing these issues by making modern, high-quality healthcare more accessible. I would like to emphasise that the work in this area must embrace all regions of the country, including Russia’s new regions. This is exactly why the task was set to ensure a systemic, comprehensive approach to integrating the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions into Russia’s common socioeconomic space. Let me recall that the Government has been instructed to draft a special development programme for the new regions before the end of the current quarter. By 2030, they should reach the national average in terms of infrastructure, social services and many other parameters of living standards. I would like to ask the Government, federal agencies and colleagues in the regions to work out, clearly and consistently, all the details of this programme. Of course, it is necessary to promptly address the most urgent, vital issues now. In fact, this is what we are doing. I understand that the situation in the new regions is complicated – hostilities continue in some areas, peaceful life has not been restored and security is not ensured in many of these regions. Naturally, it is necessary to consider all these factors, but this is not a reason to take a break and postpone the resolution of the most urgent issues. It is necessary to set specific goals now and work to achieve them gradually. This is exactly what people are waiting for – people that are really going through hard times and want to see changes for the better. It is essential to set clear and understandable development benchmarks for Russia’s new regions, so that people know what will be built in their cities and towns, which facilities will be renovated and when, how family incomes will grow, what kind of assistance they will receive from the state, how kindergartens, schools, universities, hospitals and clinics will operate, when enterprises will reopen, what kind of support small businesses and entrepreneurs will receive, and how infrastructure and transport will develop. Here I would like to emphasise the need to support local entrepreneurs. Of course, if we need investment from major Russian sources, from our large companies – private or state-owned – we need to facilitate that as well. But it is of the essence to support local businesses wherever possible. Key performance indicators for the development of the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, LPR and DPR must be established for this year, 2023. I am referring to uniform and transparent criteria for assessing not only regional and municipal, but also federal authorities, so that our colleagues at the local level join the federal Government, ministries and agencies, and direct their forces and resources towards priority areas that require attention in the first place. In addition – we have already talked about this, and I want to stress once again that – it is necessary to involve the new regions in the implementation of our national projects, and this, among other things, means that funding needs to be provided to back the activities under national projects in the territories of the DPR, LPR, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. We have discussed this many times, and I know that the Government is working hard on drafting key performance indicators for the development of the new regions and involving them in the national projects, but I would like to point this out again: this work is far from completed, and we need to resolve the outstanding issues as soon as possible. As for today's agenda, we agreed to focus on social support measures in the new regions – arranging the payment of all social benefits to the local population. Ms Golikova will report on this today. But before we begin, I would like to ask Mr Manturov to tell us how the instructions are being carried out to implement long-term programmes to upgrade the aircraft fleet and the water transport fleet. We worked on this a lot last year, and we all realise how critical these issues are, especially with regard to air transport. We discussed this just a month ago at the meeting of the Council for Strategic Development. Let's get to work. As I suggested, Mr Manturov will begin. Go ahead, please. Mr Manturov, have you received the paper that I forwarded to you? It was sent to me with the signatures of the St Petersburg Governor and the head of the company that makes Meteors, I think. It is quite a financially intensive project. Good. Financial instruments simply must be developed there. You have just mentioned them. It is necessary to provide them with a timely order.  Look here – as you have just said, 700 aircraft, including helicopters, and 260 civilian water vessels, such as ships, supply vessels and so on will be delivered by 2030. It is necessary to discuss these 700 aircraft, including helicopters, with the Defence Ministry. It should be clear how many of them the military department will order and how many civilian vessels should be produced. Some companies have not yet received an order, even for 2023. It is taking too long! Much too long. Companies need to know what their immediate plans and orders are going to be. They need to hire workers, they need to maintain or expand production capacity, do you understand that? They need to know how much the military department will order, and how many civilian aircraft will be ordered. But certain companies do not have contracts even for 2023. Mr Manturov, as long as there are no manufacturer's specifications (passports), as you mentioned yourself, and companies do not have those, just like they have no contracts, there is no understanding of what they will do or what they need to do. It is taking too long. Please, I ask you to speed up this process. Enterprises do not have contracts for 2023, what can I say to that? As you said, there are no manufacturer's specifications. When will they be ready? And there are no contracts yet. Mr Manturov, you say everything is ready to go, but there are no contracts. This is what I am telling you. Let's discuss this after the meeting. There is no point in our splitting hairs at this point. I know no contracts have been signed with the enterprises, the directors told me so. What are you fooling around for? When will the contracts be signed? This is my point. Directors of enterprises are telling me there are no contracts while you are telling me that everything is ready to go. When will the passports be available? When will the contracts be signed? These are the questions I need answers to. I want all of this to be done within a month. What quarter are you talking about? Do we not understand the circumstances we are in? Please complete this work within a month. Okay? No, do not try to do your best; please get it done in a month. It must be done in a month, no later. Agreed? Do you know why I mentioned this? I took note of some of the wording. You said, “We will do it soon.” What does “soon” mean? The timeframe must be clear and comprehensible. I am not pulling it out of thin air, am I? Directors of enterprises are telling me there are no contracts. Okay, we will get back to it with you later. We are talking every day as it is, and we will talk more today and tomorrow. Mr Savelyev, please update us on where we stand with removing containers from the Far East. We talked about this many times. I am aware that the situation has changed and cars and gondola cars are not going from the Far Eastern Russia to the European Russia empty now, but I would still like to hear your assessments. Please. Thank you. Mr Belozerov, do you have anything to add to what the Minister just said? Mr Novak, please say a few words about your area – coal shipments and so on. Are our oil-and-gas companies coping with the problems that their competitors are trying to create for them, using political mechanisms and instruments? We must take a closer look at this discount so as not to create any problems with the budget. Do you understand what I am talking about? Discuss this issue and then report your proposals to me separately, please, all right? Thank you. Mr Khusnullin, we discussed the performance of the construction sector several times. I would like you to tell our colleagues now some of the things we have talked about. We are grateful to the construction sector for these record-high results. Incidentally, I would also like to thank those who were working in the new regions, helping the Defence Ministry to build the defence lines. Regrettably, there have been casualties among construction personnel. We must not forget this, and we must help their families. Construction workers have always been respected as creators, and now their profession has become a heroic vocation. I would like to thank you and all those who were tackling the tasks facing the country in this sphere. I congratulate them on their achievements, just as I congratulated our farmers who have achieved excellent results. I am not only referring to the record harvest, which does not happen by itself, but also to the work of the sector as a whole. It did really well, achieving very good results. I am referring to the agricultural and processing complex. We had the lowest unemployment rate as of the end of 2022. How much was it, 3.7 percent? Inflation was also below expectations. In this context, I would like to ask both the Economic Development Minister and the Finance Minister to comment on these results. Mr Reshetnikov, go ahead, please. An increase in nominal wages is a good thing, but this is nothing more than statistics that we have to keep in mind. We need to ensure that households see an increase in their real incomes. This is obvious, and everyone understands this. Of course, we must factor the decelerating inflation into our overall economic policy. In fact, we all understand this. But I want the entire economic bloc to treat it this way, including the Finance Ministry. Mr Siluanov, now to you.\", 'wordlist': ['good', 'afternoon', ',', 'colleague', ',', 'we', 'be', 'hold', 'the', 'first', 'meeting', 'with', 'Government', 'member', 'in', '2023', '.', ' ', 'I',

Last January, we celebrated the 300th anniversary of the prosecutor’s office in Russia. It is notable that during this jubilee year you scored new substantial results in your work. In particular, the effectiveness of personal appointments by prosecutors at all levels, during which people receive assistance, protection and answers to pressing issues, has increased. I would like to praise your efforts to restore the violated rights of pensioners, persons with disabilities and orphaned children. I want to ask you to keep your focus on these matters, as well as to promptly redress the violations of federal economic laws and to protect the rights of entrepreneurs. A clear priority for you is to strengthen the coordination of the law enforcement agencies’ fight against crime. I would like to thank Russian prosecutors for doing this socially significant work and for their professional and unflinching approach to their jobs. I am confident that you will continue to strictly supervise the proper execution of laws and will protect people against lawlessness, negligence and arbitrariness.

I would like to draw your attention to the need for closer supervision of the timely implementation of the state defence order. Special attention must be given to ensuring the rights of military personnel, mobilised people and volunteers. It should be noted that prosecutors have all the necessary powers to efficiently deal with these and other important tasks. I have no doubt that your will do your best and will also preserve and enrich the best traditions of your predecessors.
